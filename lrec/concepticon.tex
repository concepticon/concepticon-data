\abstract{
We present an attempt to link the large amount of different concept lists (aka ``Swadesh lists'')
which are used in the linguistic literature. This resource, the \emph{Concepticon}
(\url{http://concepticon.clld.org}), links
\conceptnumber concepts labels from \listnumber conceptlists to \setnumber concept sets. Each
concept set is given a unique numerical identifier, a unique label, and a human-readable definition.
Concept sets are further structured by defining different relations between the concepts.  The
resource can be used for various purposes. Serving as a rich reference for new
and existing databases in diachronic and synchronic linguistics, it allows researchers a quick
access to studies on semantic change, cross-linguistic polysemies, and semantic associations.

\section{Introduction}
In 1950, Morris Swadesh (1909 -- 1967) proposed the idea that certain parts of the lexicon of human
languages are universal, stable over time, and rather resistant to borrowing. As a result, he
claimed that these
parts of the lexicon, which was later called \emph{basic vocabulary}, would be very
useful to address the problem of subgrouping in historical linguistics:
\begin{quote}
[...] it is a well known fact that certain types of morphemes are relatively stable. Pronouns and
numerals, for example, are occasionally replaced either by other forms from the same language or by
borrowed elements, but such replacement is rare. The same is more or less true of other everyday
expressions connected with concepts and experiences common to all human groups or to the groups
living in a given part of the world during a given epoch. \cite[157]{Swadesh1950}
\end{quote}
He illustrated this by proposing a first \emph{list of basic concepts}, which was, in fact, nothing
else than a collection of concept labels, as shown below:\footnote{This list contains 123 items in
total. According to Swadesh, these items occurred both in his original test list of English items,
and in the data on the Salishan languages, which he employed for his first glottochronological
study.}
\begin{quote}
I, thou, he, we, ye, one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, hundred, all,
animal, ashes, back, bad, bark, belly, big,
black, blood, bone, brother (elder), child
(son or daughter), cloud, cold, come, cry
(weep), dance, day, dog, dust, ear, earth, eat,
egg, eye, far, father, fire, flower, fog, foot,
good, grass, green, hair, hand, head, heart,
here, hit (with fist), hunt, husband, ice,
lake, laugh, leaf, left hand, leg, liver, long,
louse, man, meat, mother, mountain, mouth,
name, near, neck, night, nose, person, rain,
red, right hand, road (trail), root, rope, salt,
sand, short, sing, sister (elder), skin, sky,
small, smoke, snake, snow, speak, spear
(war), star, stone, sun, swim, tail, that, there,
this, tongue, tooth, tree, warm, water, what,
where, white, who, wife, wind, woman, year,
yellow. \cite[161]{Swadesh1950}
\end{quote}
In the following years, Swadesh refined his original concept lists of basic vocabulary items,
thereby reducing the original test list of 215 items first to 200 \cite{Swadesh1952} and then to 100
items \cite{Swadesh1955}. Scholars working on different language families and different datasets
provided further modifications, be it that the concepts which Swadesh had proposed were lacking
proper translational equivalents in the languages they were working on, or that they
turned out to be not as stable and universal as Swadesh had claimed \cite{Matisoff1978,Alpher1999}. 
Up to today, dozens of different concept list have been compiled for various purposes.
They are are used as heuristical tools for the detection of deep genetic
relationships among languages \cite{Dolgopolsky1964}, 
as basic values for traditional
lexicostatistical and glottochronological studies \cite{Dyen1992,Starostin1991}, 
or as litmus test
for dubious cases of language relationship which might be due to inheritance or borrowing 
\cite{McMahon2005b,Chen1996,Wang2006}. 
 
Apart from concept lists proposed for the application in historical linguistics, there is
furthermore a large amount of not explicitly diachronic data, including concept lists serving as the
basis for field work in specific linguistic areas \cite{Kraft1981}, concept lists which serve as the
basis for large surveys on specific linguistic phenomena \cite{Wold2009}, or concept lists which deal with
the internal \emph{structuring} of concepts, be it cognitive associations \cite{Nelson2004},
\emph{cross-linguistic polysemies} \cite{List2014f}, or \emph{frequently recurring semantic shifts}
\cite{Bulakh2013}. 
\section{Concept Lists}
\textcolor{red}{Here, we should work on some basic characteristics of concept lists, among these is
the basic definition we give to a concept list (as follows, from the slides), but also further
points}
Simply speaking, concept lists are lists of concepts, in which
concepts are ideally given by both glosses and short definitions. 
They can be compiled for different purposes (language
comparison, concept comparison) and be expanded by adding structure (rankings, divisions, relations).

\subsection{Purpose of Concept Lists}
\textcolor{red}{The purpose of concept lists should probably be mentioned her. Note that the purpose
is never completely exhaustively described, but we can distinguish between different basic types,
and this makes probably sense}
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Language Comparison (historical linguistics, dialectology)}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item proving genetic relationship (Yakhontov 1991/35 items, Dolgopolsky 1964/15 items)
      \item linguistic subgrouping (Norman 2003/40 items, Swadesh 1955/100 items, Starostin 1991/110 items)
      \item layer identification (Chén 1996/100+100 items, Yakhontov 1991/35+65 items)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Concept comparison (historical lingusitics, psycholinguistics)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item synchronic (word association: SimLex, Hill et al. 2014/1028 items,
	colexification: CLICS, List et al. 2014/1280 items)
      \item diachronic (semantic shift: DatSemShift, Bulakh et al. 2013/2424
	items, stability of form-meaning relations: WOLD, Haspelmath \&
	Tadmor 2009/1460 items)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Structure of Concept Lists}
\textcolor{red}{The structure, and the qeustion as to what the swadesh lists are aactually intended
to do should probably briefly be mentioned here. Using the table as it was prepared for the talk in
Leipzig may be useful, as I think, but we can probably float it and have it cover two columns}

\section{Linking Concept Lists}
\textcolor{red}{Here, we should describe the basic characteristics of the concepticon, like the way
the things are linked with each other. Maybe, including a graphic would also be useful}
The concepticon is an attempt to link the many different concept lists (``Swadesh Lists'') which are
used in the linguistic literature. In practice, all entries from the various concept lists are
linked to a \emph{concept set} as an intermediate way to reference the concepts. The Concepticon
currently links \conceptnumber concepts from \listnumber concept lists to \setnumber concept sets
and defines \relationnumber relations between the concept sets.
 
A concept list is a collection of concepts that is deemed interesting by scholars. Minimally, it
consists of an \emph{identifier} for each concept which the lists contains, and a \emph{label} by
which the concept is referenced. The creator of a concept list is called a \emph{compiler}. Each
concept list is tight to one or more \emph{sources}, it is given in one or more \emph{source
languages} and was compiled for one or more \emph{target languages}. A \emph{description} gives
further information on each concept list in free, exclusively human-readable form.
 
To facilitate our workflow and to guarantee the comparability of concept lists even if they do not
share concepts which are directly linked via our concept sets, we define additional and very simple
\emph{concept relations} between concept sets (\emph{broader}, \emph{narrower}, \emph{similar}).
Even if the concepts in two or more concept lists are not assigned to the same concept set, they can
still be assigned to concept sets via concept relations.

\section{Examples}
\textcolor{red}{Examples may be useful to be included, they could, however, also be put into a nice
graphic in which the web-application is presented along with the underlying graphs showing the
relations between the concepts}
\subsection{Rain}

\textcolor{red}{Maybe give rain as an example here, as in the slides}

\subsection{Child}

\textcolor{red}{Child example, for hierarchies}

\subsection{Burn}
\textcolor{red}{Burn example to show problems with transitivity etc.}

\section{Using the Concepticon}
\textcolor{red}{HIer eventuell zeigen, wie das Concepticon bei Dictionaria und Lexibank benutzt
werden kann}

\section{Outlook}
\textcolor{red}{heir noch mal sagen, dass wir natürlich noch weiter daran arbeiten.}
