Payne-1991-202	Payne, David L.	1991		202	English	Arawakan		Payne1991	This concept list is extracted from a collection of lexical reconstructions of Proto-Arawakan along with their reflexes in 24 Arawakan languages. The concept labels are not always easy to interprete. The author mentiones that labels in brackets result from meaning deviations in some of the reflexes, but this principle does not seem to have been followed up thoroughly all the time.	392-426
Swadesh-1954-97	Swadesh, Morris	1954		97	English	American Indian languages		Swadesh1954	According to Swadesh, this list of 97 items was extracted from a larger collection of 120 wordlists in American Indian languages. The 97 items which Swadesh labeled as &quot;non-cultural&quot; seem to be a compromise between coverage and useful items for language comparison, which would also explain the rather strange number of 97 concepts.	316-318
Luqman-2010-65	Luqman, Hirzi	2010		65	English	Bornean (Austronesian)		Luqman2010	This concept list consists of a small selection of the [Austronesian Basic Vocabulary List](:ref:Blust-2008-210). The compiler lists different reasons for shortening the list for his phylogenetic study on Bornean languages, like *resistance to borrowing*, *distinctness of the meaning*, and gaps in the data. The compiler states that there are 64 items in the data and counts them accordingly. However, there is a counting error, since the item whith the number 27 is missing in the second table of the appendix. Judging from the first table, it should be &quot;mother&quot;. Furthermore, the item &quot;Tongue&quot; is listed in the second table, but not in the first one, while &quot;grass&quot;, listed in the first table, does not occur in the second one. We marked these three cases of inconsistencies with an asterisk in the gloss. 	
SIL-2002-436	Summer Institute of Linguistics	2002		436	English	Southeast Asian languages	http://msea-ling.info/dt-library/libronline.shtml	SIL2002	This list of 436 items, which is also called the MSEA list (&quot;Mainland Southeast Asia Wordlist&quot;) was developed as an extension from an earlier list of 281 items which was developed in the 1960s and 1970s for comparative studies in Vietnam and Cambodia ([Mann 2004: 3](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Mann2004)).	1-15
Mann-2004-210	Mann, Noel W.	2004		210	English	Global	http://li.payap.ac.th/images/stories/survey/Mann%20(2004)%20(MSEA%20Comparative%20Wordlist).pdf	Mann2004	This list contains those elements which -- according to the analysis of the compiler -- occur in the alternative conceptlist by Matisoff ([1978](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200)). Although Mann himself writes that this list contains 209 items, we could find 210 items in the first representation which he published. The difference is due to the concept &quot;you (plural)&quot; which originally does not occur in Matisoff's list but is included in the big [comparative list of Mann](:ref:Mann-2004-500) as an item that appears on Matisoff's list. 	3-13
Mann-2004-209	Mann, Noel W.	2004		209	English	Global	http://li.payap.ac.th/images/stories/survey/Mann%20(2004)%20(MSEA%20Comparative%20Wordlist).pdf	Mann2004	This list contains those elements which -- according to the analysis of the compiler -- occur in the union of both lists proposed by Swadesh ([1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). Although Mann himself writes that this list contains 210 items, we could only find 209 items in both representations which he published. The difference in contrast to the &quot;traditional&quot; accounts which list [207 items](:ref:Comrie-1977-207) is that Mann counts certain concepts differently. Thus, he counts &quot;grease&quot; and &quot;fat (nount)&quot; as different concepts. 	3-13
Mann-2004-118	Mann, Noel W.	2004		118	English	South-East Asian	http://li.payap.ac.th/images/stories/survey/Mann%20(2004)%20(MSEA%20Comparative%20Wordlist).pdf	Mann2004	This is an excerpt of a longer comparative wordlist proposed in [Mann (2004)](:ref:Mann-2004-500). In this list, only those basic concepts are listed which occur in at least three different word lists, namely the combined lists of Swadesh [(1952, 1955)](:ref:Mann-2004-209), as proposed by Mann himself, the [210-item list by Matisoff (1978)](:ref:Mann-2004-210), also in the analysis of Mann, and the [Southeast Asia 436 wordlist](:ref:SIL-2002-436). Note, that, although this list should actually be based on the larger comparative list of 500 items in the same reference, the concept labels diverge in part from the ones used in the larger list. Thus, instead of &quot;cut&quot;, we find &quot;cut (with knife)&quot;, and &quot;cloud&quot; is labelled as &quot;cloud (white)&quot;.	13-16
Nahhas-2006-100	Nahhas, Ramzi W. and Mann, Noel W.	2006		100	English	Global	http://li.payap.ac.th/images/stories/survey/Steps%20of%20Word%20Lists.pdf	Nahhas2006	According to the compilers, this list is a replication of the [100 item list by Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). The author further add semantic field descriptions of the 100 items in an ad-hoc manner.	7
He-2010-207	{Hé Yǔyīn 何宇茵} and {Mǎ Sài 马赛}	2010		207	Chinese	Chinese Sign Language		He2010	According to the authors, this list of 207 items stems directly from Morris Swadesh's work. However, since Swadesh himself never published a list of 207 items, it is more likely that they took the 207 items from one of those compilers who merged Swadeshs lists of [100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and [200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), such as, for example, the early list by [Comrie (1977)](:ref:Comrie-1977-207). In their paper, the authors investigate the iconicity of basic concepts in Chinese sign language. They distinguish three different degrees of iconicity: &quot;strong&quot; &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;no&quot; inonicity.	56 
Lin-2010-89	{Lín Tiānsòng 林天送} and {Fàn Yíng 范莹}	2010		89	Chinese, English	Chinese		Lin2010	This is a shortened version of the 100-item list by [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). Serving as a basis for a lexicostatistical study of 16 Mǐn dialects, the author discarded 11 items (&quot;all&quot; 全部, &quot;bark&quot; 樹皮, &quot;hair&quot; 頭髮, &quot;hair&quot;, &quot;knee&quot; 膝蓋, &quot;neck&quot; 脖子, &quot;swim&quot; 游泳, &quot;we&quot; 我們, &quot;what&quot; 設么, &quot;who&quot; 誰, &quot;man&quot; 男人, and &quot;woman&quot; 女人), for the reason that these words had the tendency to belong to borrowed layers in the dialects.	667-669 
Jacques-2015-249	Jacques, Guillaume and List, Johann-Mattis and Sagart, Laurent	2015		249	English	Sino-Tibetan	http://tsv.lingpy.org?file=sinotibetan&remote_dbase=sinotibetan		This is a conceptlist that is supposed to serve as the basis of a lexical homology database of Sino-Tibetan languages. The criteria for choosing the list items are a compromise between previously published concept lists, especially the ones published by Swadesh ([1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and [1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200)) and [Blust](:ref:Blust-2008-210), but also including frequently occuring concepts in large comparative resources on Tibeto-Burman languages ([Huáng and Dài 1992](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Huang1992)) and Chinese dialects ([Hànyǔ Fāngyán Cíhuì, 1992](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Cihui)). The list contains a mapping to the concept keys used by Huáng and Dài (1992), stored in the colum &quot;TBL_ID&quot;.	
Zheng-2007-86	Zhēng Chūnlán 郑春兰	2007		86	Chinese	Chinese		Zheng2007	This is conceptlist was used to study basic words in the Oracle Bone inscriptions. The wordlist itself is originally based on the list by [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), but the author discarded the function words in the analysis and used also certain translations which diverge from the concepts originally proposed by Swadesh. Thus, instead of &quot;to know&quot; Zhēng uses &quot;to understand&quot; (Chinese *dǒng* 懂), and Chinese *rè* 熱 is better translated as &quot;hot&quot; than as &quot;warm&quot;. In addition, Zhēng also offers semantic categories for the 86 concepts.	68
Comrie-1977-207	Comrie, Bernard and Smith, N.	1977		207	English	Global	https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/tools-at-lingboard/questionnaire/linguaQ.php	Comrie1977	Judging from the number of items, it is clear that this list is a merger of the two concept lists proposed by Swadesh in [1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). There are, however, some deviations from Swadesh's original concept labels, and these again show that the list of [Gudschinsky (1956)](:ref:Gudschinksy-1956-200) may have served as the base list for 200 of the 207 items. Since the list appears in an influential questionnaire for linguistic fieldwork, it can be expected that the impact of this list on fieldworkers was much higher than the impact of the original concept lists proposed by Swadesh.	
Bowern-2008-207	Bowern, Claire	2008		207	English	Global	http://pamanyungan.sites.yale.edu/sites/default/files/SwadeshSemField.pdf	Bowern2008	In the supplementary material to her practical guide on fieldwork, Bowern offers a concept list which is organized by semantic fields. In the book, a normal concept list is given, which is, according to the compiler, taken from [the list by Comrie and Smith](:ref:Comrie-1977-207), although it contains a small amount of modifications. Here, we show only the online list, not the list in the book, since the semantic field ordering seems to be more interesting than the raw listing of concept labels.	35f, 223f 
Tryon-1983-200	Tryon, Darrel T. and Hackman, Brian D.	1983		200	English	Melanesian		Tryon1983	This list is based on the two lists published in [Samarin (1967)](:ref:sources/samarin1967), and was used to carry out a lexicostatistic subgrouping of the languages of the Solomon islands. The compilers note that they replaced forty items which were found unsuitable for their comparison with alternative concepts. In the list, those concepts which, according to the compilers, stem from [Samarin's list of 100 items](:ref:Samarin-1967-100) are marked with one asterisk, those items which stem from [the list of 200 items](:ref:Samarin-1967-200) are marked with two asterisks, and the 40 additional items are left unmarked. This list is a subset of a larger [list of 324 items](:ref:Tryon-1983-324) that was collected and published along with the source and used for broader investigations, including the determination of regular sound correspondences.	28f
Tryon-1983-324	Tryon, Darrel T. and Hackman, Brian D.	1983		324	English	Melanesian		Tryon1983	This list was used to carry out comparative investigations of the languages of the Solomon islands. The compilers also provide a shorter [list of 200 items](:ref:Tryon-1983-200) which they used to carry out a lexicostatistic subgrouping of the languages.	115-118
Ringe-2002-333	Ringe, Donald and Warnow, Tandy and Taylor, Ann	2002		333	English	Indo-European	 http://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/CPHL/ie-wordlist-07.pdf	Ringe2002	This list was used for a cladistic study of 24 Indo-European languages ([Ringe et al. 2002](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Ringe2002)). The authors describe the list as being derived from the two traditional Swadesh lists ([Swadesh 1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), and [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100)), to which they added an additional number of 121 lexical items which are supposed to be indicative of subgrouping of Indo-European languages. The first two Swadesh lists originally make up about 207 items, but since the compilers further split five items into two sets, the &quot;Swadesh part&quot; of the list consists of 212 items in total. For this reason, the complete list contains 333 items. The compilers give further specifications of some of their concepts which we added in an additional column called ANNOTATION. Since many of these specifications are, however, optional, they were not entirely considered to carry out the mapping.	 
Pozdniakov-2014-100b	Pozdniakov, Konstantin	2014	b	100	English	Atlantic	http://jolr.ru/files/(144)jlr2014-11(187-237).pdf	Pozdniakov2014	This list presents stability ranks for the Atlantic languages by using a modified version of the ranking procedure proposed by [Starostin (2007)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Starostin2007). In contrast to the original ranking procedure, the results are calculated by averaging them. The Atlantic language data underlying the ranking covers etymological data for 41 different languages. Since we know that the concept labels in this list are meant to denote the same concepts as those presented in the list by [Starostin (2007)](:ref:Starostin-2007-110), there are some mappings which may seem unintuitive (&quot;ground&quot; being mapped to &quot;EARTH (SOIL)&quot;), since they result from different translations from the Russian source into English.  202
Pozdniakov-2014-100a	Pozdniakov, Konstantin	2014	a	100	English	Global	http://jolr.ru/files/(144)jlr2014-11(187-237).pdf	Pozdniakov2014	This list presents an alternative ranking of the data underlying the ranked list presented by [Starostin (2007)](:ref:Starostin-2007-110). In contrast to the original ranking, it calculates the results by averaging them. Given that we know the original data underlying this list, the mapping to concept sets was carried out by comparing with our mapping of Starostin's ranked list. As a result, there are some mappings which may seem unintuitive (&quot;ground&quot; being mapped to &quot;EARTH (SOIL)&quot;), but they result from different translations from the Russian source into English, not from wrong mappings.  200
List-2014-1280	List, Johann-Mattis and Mayer, Thomas and Terhalle, Anselm and Urban, Matthias	2014		1280	English	Global	http://clics.lingpy.org	List2014	This is the concept list underlying the [Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications (CLICS)](http://clics.lingpy.org). This list is a subset of the concept list underlying the [Intercontinental Dictionary Series](:ref:Key-2015-1310) and it offers an extended colexification analysis of all data underlying the 2007 version of the IDS along with data from different sources. Instead of providing full graphs for the networks, we provide links to the major clusters for each concept in CLICS. CLICS distinguishes two different kinds of cluster analyses: a community analysis, which can be accessed via the link in the ``CLUSTER_URL`` column, and a subgraph analysis, which can be accessed via the link in the ``SUBGRAPH_URL`` column. The column ``COMMUNITY_LABEL`` list the most central node in each of the community clusters in CLICS. The column ``FREQUENCY`` lists the number of times a translation for a given concept occurs in the CLICS data, and the column ``DEGREE`` contains the weighted degree for each node, weighted by the number of distinct language families underlying each link.	 
Urban-2011-160	Urban, Matthias	2011		160	English	Global		Urban2011	This list was created for the purpose of investigating directional aspects of semantic change patterns by investigating patterns of colexification an overt marking in a large sample of languages. The concept list itself is inspired by the list of the [Intercontinental Dictionary Series](:ref:Key-2015-1310) and the list of the [World Loanword Database](:ref:Haspelmath-2009-1460), but contains additional items which cannot be found on either of the two concept lists. The compiler lists findings regarding directed patterns of semantic change by providing source and target concept as well as the number of colexifications and the number of overtly marked cases. These patterns (a total of 47) are provided in the column ``SEMANTIC CHANGE``, where we list the number of the pattern in the source in square brackets, the source and the target concept, and the number of colexifications and overtly marked cases in normal brackets.	9-13, 46f
Key-2015-1310	Key, Mary Ritchie and Comrie, Bernard	2015		1310	English, Russian, French, Portuguese, Spanish	Global	http://ids.clld.org	Key2015	This is the most recent version of the concept list underlying the [Intercontinental Dictionary Series](http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de) which was first launched in 2007 and now significantly enhanced and expanded (while the concept list itself was left unchanged). The list also served as the core list underlying the [World Loanwoard Database](http://wold.clld.org) and was used for the investigation of cross-linguistic colexification patterns in the [CLICS database](http://clics.lingpy.org).	 
Beaufils-2015-18	Beaufils, Vincent	2015		18	English	Global	http://www.elinguistics.net/Lexical_comparison.html	Beaufils2015	This list is proposed as part of the [eLinguistics.net project](http://www.elinguistics.net) which aims to automatically compare languages all over the world by means of 18 words which are converted to sound classes and compared for similarity by using pre-established scores for sound-correspondence probability (using the findings by [Brown et al. 2011](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Brown2011)). According to the compiler, the selection of the words was based on a comparison of proposed concept lists (e.g. by [Jakhontov](:ref:Jakhontov-1991-35), [Dolgopolsky](:ref:Dolgopolsky-1964-15), and [Holman](:ref:Holman-2008-40)) along with a test of the performance of the words in producing senseful language trees based on the algorithm proposed by the eLinguistics.net project.	  
Nagaraja-2013-200	Nagaraja, K. S. and Sidwell, Paul and Greenhill, Simon	2013		200	English	Khasian		Nagaraja2013	This list was used for a lexicostatistical investigation of four Khasian languages. Judging from the concept labels, it was directly derived from [Gudschinsky's list of 200 items](:ref:Gudschinsky-1956-200) and is therefore not completely identical with [Swadesh's list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200). Furthermore, the compilers read the concept label &quot;lie&quot; as &quot;lie, deceive&quot;, while most other concept lists read it as &quot;lie, rest&quot;.	7-11
Borin-2015-1532	Borin, Lars	2015		1532	English	Global	http://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/resource/lwt-pwn	Borin2013	This list is basically identical with the concept list used in the [Intercontinental Dictionary Series](:ref:Borin-2015-1300), yet it contains an additional mapping to the [Princeton Wordnet](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn) provided by the compiler. It thus defines additional metadata that may be useful for different purposes. Note that the linking to the Princeton Wordnet is not unique, but *one to many*: One concept of the original concept list may be linked to multiple senses of the Princeton Wordnet. The additional columns give the identifier used in the Intercontinental Dictionary Series (IDS_KEY), the Princeton Wordnet Word Sense (PWN_WORD_SENSE), the definition of the Princeton Wordnet (PWN_DEFINITION). As additional links which may turn out to be useful, we added the corresponding synsets of the Princeton Wordnet (PWN_SYNSET), the part of speech as defined for the synset by the Princeton Wordnet, and a weblink to the [Open Multilingual Wordnet](http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/) (OMW_URL).	
Youn-2015-22	Youn, Hyejin and Sutton, Logan and Smith, Eric and Moore, Cristopher and Wilkins, Jon F. and Maddieson, Ian and Croft, William and Bhattacharya, Tanmoy	2015		22	English	Global		Youn2015	This concept list contains a small subset of [Swadeshs list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) to investigate polysemy structures in which the concepts are involded in a large sample of the languages of the world.	22
Woodward-1991-100	Woodward, James	1991		100	English	Sign languages		Woodward1991	According to the compiler, this concept list was first compiled and employed in 1978 for a comparative study of the LESCO and ASL sign languages. Since almost all sign languages denote body parts iconically, by pointing to them, the classical lists by Morris Swadesh, such as his [list of 100 items (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), or his [list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) turned out to be insufficient for comparative studies of sign languages. This list was published in many different references. We quote here the earliest version we could find ([Woodward 1978](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Woodward1978) doesn't contain a full list). Later versions differ slightly in their label for [item 19](:ref:Woodward-1991-100-19), which is alternatively labeled as either &quot;fat&quot; ([Woodward 1993](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Woodward1993)) or &quot;grease&quot; ([Woodward 2009](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Woodward2009)).	331
Swadesh-1971-100	Swadesh, Morris	1971		100	English	Global		Swadesh1971	This is a post-humously published 100-item list by Morris Swadesh. Basically, it is identical with the one published in [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet the labels in this list are simplified and not completely identical with the ones proposed before. In the version we consulted, some items seem to have been written in italic font, although we couldn't find any general pattern, what this practice might hint to. In order to keep as closely to the original, however, we marked all those entries with an asterisk.	273 
Swadesh-1950-165	Swadesh, Morris	1950		165	English	Salish		Swadesh1950	The first list which was actually used by Morris Swadesh. Initially, Swadesh started from a concept list of 215 items, yet since the data did not allow to identify all of these, he then reduced the test list to 165 items for which he had enough attestations in the Salish languages.	161
Hou-2004-180	Hóu Jīngyī 侯精一	2004		180	Chinese	Chinese		Hou2004	This list is used as a basic concept list for a survey of 40 Chinese dialect varieties.	
Wiktionary-2003-207	Wiktionary	2003		207	English	Global	http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Swadesh_lists	Wiktionary, Swadesh1952, Swadesh1955	"As far as it is possible to follow the editing history of the [Wiktionary project](http://en.wiktionary.org), it seems that this concept list was first proposed in 2003. It was supposed to be a pure merger of the concepts which Swadesh proposed in [1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). However, the editors did not notice (or deliberately ignored) that the former list explicitly lists the intransitive form of ""to burn"", while the latter lists ""to burn"" as transitive. Similar problems hold for ""rain"" which is explicitly labelled as a verb in the 200 item list, while no further specification is given in the 100 item list. One may of course say that these differences are minor ones, yet as a comparison with alternative approaches using the classical ""Swadesh list"" show, the incomplete descriptions of glosses have lead to a rather great degree of fuzziness in the application of concept lists for the purpose of language comparison."	
Yakhontov-1991-35	Yakhontov, Sergej	1991		35	Russian, English	Global		Starostin1991	This is the supposedly most stable part of [Jachontovs list of 100 items](:ref:Jachontov-1991-100).	93
Alpher-1999-151	Alpher, Barry and Nash, David	1999		151	English	Australian		Alpher1999	This list was originally proposed in order to carry out lexicostatistical studies of Australian languages. Its core part is based on a list of 100 items proposed by [O'Grady and Klokeid in 1969](:ref:OGrady-1969-100).	53-55
McMahon-2005-30	McMahon, April and McMahon, Robert	2005		30	English	Indo-European		McMahon2005	"This is what the authors call a ""hihi"" list for Indo-European languages in the database by [Dyen et al. (1997)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Dyen1997), that is, a list high in ""reconstructability"" and high in ""retentiveness"". So the items are supposed to be among the most stable concepts that can be found in the Indo-European languages."	109
Kassian-2010-116	Kassian, Alexej and Starostin, Georgij and Dybo, A. and Chernov, V.	2010		116	English, Russian	Global		Kassian2010	This is an attempt by the authors to further specify the meanings of concept lists for the purpose of language comparison. They take the list of [Starostin 1991](:ref:Starostin-1991-110) as a basis, which is itself a merger of the concept list proposed by [Sergej Jachontov](:ref:Jachontov-1991-100) and the 100-item list proposed by [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). This lists contains a total of 116 items, since the authors subdivided certain parts of the 110-item list in order to get a more precise definition of the concepts. Thus, the authors clearly distinguish between different kinds of &quot;thin&quot;, depending on the shape of the object (be it flat or long). 	51-89
Gabelentz-1891-121	Gabelentz, Hans Georg Conon	1891		121	German	Global		Gabelentz1891	"This list is not a real concept list in the strict sense, but rather a proposal for a useful semantic ordering of lexical entries for the purpose of language comparison. Gabelentz himself calls these ""Collectaneen zum Verwandtschaftsnachweise"" (""collections [of words] for the purpose of proving language relationship""), and instead of providing strict glosses to be translated into different languages, he provides a schema on how a given collection of lexical entries can be ordered in order to ease the work of historical linguists. Despite the fact that this is no real concept list, we thought it would be useful to include it inour collection, since it illustrates one important purpose of concept lists: to provide an initial heuristic to search for probably related words. Since Gabelentz does not provide direct glosses as examples for all parts of his schema, we added some hopefully useful examples in all those cases where an original gloss was missing. These cases, which constitute the majority of this concept list, are marked with help of an asterisk preceding the gloss."	177f

David	1974		100	English	Phillipine languages		Zorc1974	This is supposed to be the typical [100 item Swadesh list](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet the glossing differs from the original, showing some interesting modifications resulting from the target languages used in the investigation.	432f
Gudschinsky-1956-200	Gudschinsky, Sara C.	1956		200	English	Global		Gudschinsky1956	Although the compiler of this list claims that this list reflects the original [Swadesh-list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), it contains in fact some deviations. For example, Gudschinsky introduces dashed labels (like &quot;fat-grease&quot;) in those cases where Swadesh had put one of the items in brackets (like &quot;fat (grease)&quot;). This practice has led to some confusion in later work by scholars who would claim to use Swadesh's list of 200 items but who were in fact only referring to Gudschinsky's list.	186-200
Samarin-1967-218	Samarin, William J.	1967		218	English	Global		Samarin1967	"As the compiler of this concept list notes, the reason why there are 218 concepts for what the compiler himself calls a 200-word list, is that the list is a ""conflation of [Swadesh 1955](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Swadesh1955) (where the words are listed both by semantic groups and alphabetically) and [Gudschinsky 1956](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Gudschinsky1956a)."" In the list, those items which are missing in Gudschinsky are marked with an asterisk. As the original source suggests, the list is intended to serve as a starting point for field work. The compiler of the list seems to be indifferent regarding the validity of lexicostatistics, but deems the word lists quite useful for comparison with other resources. In the study, the author also presents a [100-item list](:ref:Samarin-1967-100) which is given in a more detailed form along with additional translations into French, Spanish, and German."	220
Dixon-1919-175	Dixon, Roland B. and Kroeber, A. L.	1919		173	English	languages of California		Dixon1919	This is an early example of a concept list which was employed for the purpose of language comparison. Strictly speaking, the list itself contains much less conceptual items than 173, since the authors list items which are expressed by multiple cognate sets in the languages of California separately. In order to get these cognate sets, they used a list of 225 English words which is, unfortunately, not reported in the study. According to the authors, the list of cognate sets contains 175 items, but in the source, only 171 items are listed, with 2 further being labeled as secondary in the source. In order to keep close to the original, we decided to add their concept list in unmodified form to the concepticon.	56-61
Allen-2007-500	Allen, Brian	2007		500	English, Chinese	Bai		Allen2007	This list was taken as the reference for conducting field work on the Bai dialects, a minority language spoken in South-West China.

The list was created by extracting all concepts occuring three or more times within a sourc-target-relation in the database. The original number of concepts is rather large (we counted as many as 2424 distinct glosses). In selecting only a subset of these, we hope to reduce the number of more or less identical concepts which are assigned different glosses and IDs in the database.

Swadesh-1960-100a	Swadesh, Morris	1960	a	100	English	Global		Hymes1960	"The source labels this list as Swadesh's standard list of 100 items, so it should be identical with the [one he published in 1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). However, the concept labels differ to some degree. Be it for reasons of space or for other reasons unknown to us, all additional information of the labels was removed, thus making it impossible to distinguish, for example, whether &quot;burn&quot; is aiming at the transitive or the intransitive version of the concept. Similar confusion is created by items like &quot;flesh&quot; (is it human, animal, serving as food, or referring to the substance of living creatures?), and &quot;rain&quot; (verb or noun?), which actually also occurs on the [second, supposedly less stable list](:ref:Swadesh-1960-100b) also attributed to Swadesh and reported in the same source."	6

This is, however, not the case, since the list differs greatly in the labels for the glosses originally used by Swadesh. Given the idiosyncratic structure of labeling which uses dash-symbols to label concepts with help of two glosses (e.g., &quot;hold-take&quot;, &quot;meat-flesh&quot;), it is much more likely that the source would use the [version published by Gudschinsky](:ref:Gudschinsky-1956-200). It is, not exactly identical with Gudschinsky's version of Swadesh's list of 200 items, since it uses slightly different concept labels in which, for example, question marks for interrogatives are omitted. In the mapping to our Concepticon, however, these minor modifications in the labels do not show up and all items are mapped to the same concept. We add it in our collection in order to illustrate how easily changes have been propagated in the history of concept list compilation."	6
Swadesh-1960-100b	Swadesh, Morris	1960	b	100	English	Global		Hymes1960	"According to the source, this list was proposed by Swadesh as a diagnostic test list that could supplement the [list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) in case researchers would face difficulties in identifying all translational equivalents for the 100 item list. Unfortunately, the only source which we could find for this list, [Hymes (1960)](http:bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Hymes1960), presents the concept glosses in an abbreviated form which does not allow us to distinguish whether we are dealing with verbal or nominal meanings. As a confusing result of this, the concept ""rain"" occurs twice, both in this [stable list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1960-100a) (item 76) and in this supplementary list (item 121)."	6

When mapping the concepts to the concepticon, we hade some problems in finding the correct mapping for quite a few concepts.

Note that although the author mentions in his thesis on page 44 that a total of 410 words (meanings) were used to collect the data, we find as many as 423 words, including some duplicate entries, but also some entries which are obviously near synonyms but were probably split into different semantic slots by the author (who himself marks seven additional entries as not belonging to the original concept). Entries marked with an asterisk seem to reflect items which also occur on traditional concept lists and were given in the spreadsheet version of the data. Entries ending on the percentage character are those marked as later added by the author in the original source. Why some entries are marked with two greater-then characters in the spreadsheet data of the author is not entirely clear to us, but we kept it in order to provide all information that is available.	176-239
