Zhao-2006-201	Zhào, Yànzhēn 趙燕珍	2006		201	basic	Chinese	Zhaozhuang Bai		Zhao2006		This is a concept list prepared to illustrate basic lexemes in Zhaozhuang Bai, a Southern Bai variety spoken in the South of Dali in Yunnan (China). The author intended to use Swadesh's [list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), but there are a few derivations. Interestingly, some concepts are also identical (like the Chinese items for SKY and DAY (NOT NIGHT)), due to ambiguities in the glossing language. Furthermore, as in many Chinese lists, we observe a wrong translation from DULL, being rendered as STUPID rather than DULL of a knife.		
Savelyev-2020-254	Savelyev, Alexander and Robbeets, Martine	2020		254	basic	English	Turkic languages	https://zenodo.org/record/3555174/files/turkic_alignment.tsv?download=1	Savelyev2020		This concept list, which extends the classical [Swadesh list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) by the [Leipzig-Jakarta list](:ref:Tadmor-2009-100) was used for a phylogenetic study on Turkic languages.		
Carling-2019-99	Carling, Gerd and Cronhamn, Sandra and Farren, Robert and Aliyev, Elnur and Frid, Johan	2019		99	lolo,ranked	English	Global	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223588.s005	Carling2019		This is a ranked list of concepts that are supposed to be rather prone to borrowing. The ranking stem from an analysis of borrowing frequencies, assessed by means of a manual tagging of those words that were found to be borrowings in the database. The data are ranked from the highest to the lowest degree of borrowability.		
Ceolin-2019-168	Ceolin, Andrea	2019		168	basic	English	Altaic	https://github.com/AndreaCeolin/Significant-Testing-of-Altaic/	Ceolin2019		This list was used to investigate experiments on significance testing of language relatedness. The list is basically oriented towards the [200-item list of Swadesh](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), but discards some of the items for reasons mentioned in detail in the paper.		
Rojas-2019-5	Rojas-Berscia, Luis Miguel and Roberts, Sean	2019		5	specific	English	Southern American Languages	https://github.com/seannyD/BersciaHistoryOfPronounsInSouthAmerica	Rojas2019		This very small list if five pronoun terms was used for a phylogenetic study in South American languages.		
Wang-2004-471	Wang, Feng	2004		471	questionnaire,basic	English,Chinese	Bai dialects (Tibeto-Burman)		Wang2004b		This concept list was used for a study on Bai dialects, based on original field work by the author. The thesis was published officially two years later ([Wang 2006](:bib:Wang2006)), potentially with small modifications. The seemingly inconsistent numbering of concepts indicates a probably larger questionnaire underlying the data which was published in the end. In some cases, English glosses were missing or not complete. We have added them and indicated this by putting them in square brackets.		
Bodt-2019-664	Bodt, Timotheus A. and List, Johann-Mattis	2019		664	questionnaire,proto-language	English	Kho-Bwa (Tibeto-Burman)		Bodt2019		This list was extracted from a larger questionnaire for fieldwork of the Western Kho-Bwa languages and later assembled for a prediction experiment.		
Sagart-2019-250	Sagart, Laurent and Jacques, Guillaume and Lai, Yunfan and Ryder, Robin and Thouzeau, Valentin and Greenhill, Simon J. and List, Johann-Mattis	2019		250	basic	English	Sino-Tibetan	http://dighl.github.io/sinotibetan/	Sagart2019		This list was used for a phylogenetic study on Sino-Tibetan languages. As the items were selected by taking the list of [Huang et al. (1992)](:ref:Huang-1992-1820) as reference, it also indicates to which item of this list the supposed items correspond.	242-253	
SoHartmann-1988-280	So-Hartmann, Helga	1988		280	basic	English	Chin varieties (Tibeto-Burman)		SoHartmann1988		This list was used for a study of Chin varieties, which was later digitized as part of the [STEDT](https://stedt.berkeley.edu/) project.		
Castro-2010-511	Castro, Andy and Hansen, Bruce	2010		511	questionnaire	English,Chinese	Zhuang dialects (Tai-Kadai)		Castro2010a		This list provides a rather large range of concepts used for a mutual intelligibility survey of Zhuang dialects of the Hongshui He area.	60-107	
Castro-2010-540	Andy Castro and Brian Crook and Royce Flaming	2010		540	questionnaire	English,Chinese	Yi dialects (Tibeto-Burman)		Castro2010		This list was used for a sociolinguistic survey of closely related Yi varieties spoken in the Heqing province in Yunnan (China).	61-92	
Chen-2012-888	Chén, Qíguāng 陳其光	2012		888	questionnaire	Chinese	Hmong-Mien languages		Chen2012		This very long and only partially linked list is based on a survey of Hmong-Mian languages, which was particularly focusing on historical language comparison. The English glosses were added by us, by comparing specifically which glosses other scholars from China used in their collections where they provided English glosses.	567-862	
Huang-1992-1820	Huáng, Bùfán 黃布凡	1992		1820	questionnaire	Chinese,English	Sino-Tibetan languages		Huang1992		This extremely long and only marginally linked concept list is taken from the very influential survey of Sino-Tibetan (or Tibeto-Burman) languages published in 1992. The data has also been digitized by the [STEDT](https://stedt.berkeley.edu/) project, but in this version, the Chinese elicitation glosses are not provided. For the version we list here, Doug Cooper provided a digitized version of the Chinese glosses.	1-608	TBL
Lama-2012-301	Lama, Ziwo Qiu-Fuyuan	2012		301	basic, proto-language	Chinese,English	Yi (Tibeto-Burman)		Lama2012		This list was used for the initial proposal of a subgrouping for the Nisoic or Yi subgroup of Tibeto-Burman. The numbering starts with 0, which is why the list contains a total of 300 items. Data was taken from different sources, which may also have influenced the choice of concepts.		
Walworth-2018-215	Walworth, Mary and Shimelman, Aviva	2018		215	basic,areal	English,Bislama	Vanuatu languages		Walworth2018		This list is closely related to the basic wordlist of the [Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database](:ref:Blust-2008-210), but it lists additional personal pronouns.		Vanuatu Basic Words
Hale-1973-1798	Hale, Austin	1973		1798	questionnaire,areal	English	Languages spoken in Nepal		Hale1973		This huge questionnaire is based on a large survey of languages in Nepal.		
Castro-2015-608	Castro, Andy and Pan, Xingwen	2015		608	questionnaire,areal	English,Chinese	Sui	https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/64425	Castro2015	Castro2015	This large concept list was used as the basis for a detailed investigation of Sui dialects. The study was first published in Chinese and later translated into English. Andy Castro was so friendly to share his bilingual concept list with us. This facilitated the concept mapping process greatly, although we could not map all concepts to Concepticon.	377-382	
Perrin-2010-110	Perrin, Loïc-Michel	2010		110	annotated	English,German,French	Global	https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/xmlpage/1/article/353?htmlOnce=yes	Perrin2010	Perrin2010	This list was used as an initial questionnaire for colexification studies on a world-wide sample of languages.	276f	
Sun-1991-1004	Sun, Hongkai et al.	1991		1004	questionnaire	English,Chinese	Tibeto-Burman languages	http://stedt.berkeley.edu/~stedt-cgi/rootcanal.pl	Sun1991		This concept list originally served as a questionnaire for a large-scale investigation on Tibeto-Burman languages. The original questionnaire was in Chinese with no English translation. Later the [STEDT project](:bib:Matisoff2015) digitized the data, translating Chinese concept labels to English, but not listing the original Chinese forms. As a result, some concept labels are identical, although they are different in the Chinese version. We are still trying to add the original Chinese concept labels to this resource, but for the moment, we only link the STEDT version, occasionally adding Chinese concept labels, where we figure they are important to distinguish the original meaning.		
Robinson-2012-398	Robinson, Laura C and Holton, Gary	2012		398	basic	English	Alor-Pantar languages	http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22105832-20120201	Robinson2012		The authors inform that the list is built upon the about 400 items of [Holton (2012)](:bib:Holton2012), but this source did not submit the dataset.		
Heggarty-2020-200	Heggarty, Paul and Anderson, Cormac and Scarborough, Matthew	2020		200	basic	English	Indo-European languages	http://cobl.clld.org	Scarborough2020		This is the basic list of 200 items which were selected for the Cognates in Basic Lexicon project. The compilers selected the items following various different criteria, such as ease of elicitation, non-fuzziness of the meaning, representation in Indo-European languages, and more. The numbers are at times higher than 200. This results from the earlier selection which containted more concepts which were no longer used in the official version.		
Hill-2017-240	Hill, Nathan W. and List, Johann-Mattis	2017		240	basic,areal	English	Burmish languages	https://zenodo.org/record/886116	Hill2017		This list is a small subset of the larage list of almost 2000 items which was used for the survey of Sino-Tibetan languages by [Huáng (1992)](:bib:Huang1992), usually called the *Tibet-Burman lexicon* or simply abbreviated as TBL. The authors slightly modified the glosses in their investigation of Burmish languages in the TBL, but the links to the are added in the column TBL_ID.		
Serva-2012-200	Serva, Maurizio  and Petroni, Filippo and Volchenkov, Dima  and Wichmann, Søren	2012		200	basic	English	Malagasy dialects	http://people.disim.univaq.it/%7Eserva/languages/english.html	Serva2012		This list which resembles Swadesh's list of [200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) closely, was compiled for a study of several varieties of Malagasy dialects. Given that we only had the concept labels for linking, and nobody of the current team knows much about Malagasy dialects, the linking may be sub-optimal at times, and if users detect errors or have suggestions on refinements, we would be very glad if they contacted us.		
Bender-1971-99	Bender, M. L.	1971		99	basic	English	Ethiopian	https://www.jstor.org/stable/30029540?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents	Bender1971	Bender1971	This list of 99 concepts for a lexical study on Ethiopian is mainly based on the classical [Swadesh list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100).	169	
Dellert-2017-1016	Dellert, Johannes and Jäger, Gerhard	2017		1016	questionnaire	English,German,Russian	North-Eurasian languages	http://www.northeuralex.org	Dellert2017		This huge dataset lists translations for as many as 1016 concepts into more than 100 North-Eurasian languages. Concept sets have been linked to the Concepticon with help of the editors of the database, and since more than 200 concepts were not yet included in the Concepticon, this greatly increased the number of concept sets which we have by now. The data is further ranked, following some kind of stability score which was based on a method presented in [Dellert and Buch 2016](:bib:Dellert2016). The data are available from the columns RANK and STABILITY_SCORE. Currently, we do not yet display the weblinks to the online application, but only the internal ID, which can be retrieved from the downloadable data in CLDF format from the website.		
Ray-1895-26	Ray, Sidney H.	1895		26	ultra-stable,areal	English	Britich New Guina Languagse (Melanesian and Papuan)		Ray1895	Ray1895	This early concept list was compiled to study genetic relationships among languages of New Guinea. The author reports himself that he was specifically looking into words of common usage in order to determine whether they are related among different branches.	33-39	
Backstrom-1992-210a	Backstrom, Peter C. and Radloff, Carla F.	1992	a	210	basic,areal	English	Pakistanian languages		Backstrom1992	Backstrom1992	This list was compiled for a sociolinguistic survey of language use in Pakistan. The list of 210 items is supposed to represent a standardized list used to investigate all languages in the field work survey. However, as can be seen when comparing the official list of 210 items with the concept labels given in the concrete surveys on specific language families, as the list of [Balti dialects](:ref:Backstrom-1992-210b), it becomes obvious that not only some items are missing, but also that certain meanings have been modified, probably in order to make sure that enough words could be elicited. Although all glosses for «verbal meanings» are highly complex, we link them all to the basic concept sets, since from the survey it is clear that the authors adjusted them in order to elicite those verbal forms which represent the root of a given concept most consistently.	209-214	
Backstrom-1992-210b	Backstrom, Peter C. and Radloff, Carla F.	1992	b	205	basic,areal	English	Balti dialects		Backstrom1992		This is the concrete list which was used for Balti dialects (Tibetan group of Sino-Tibetan) in the large survey of languages in Pakistan (see the [general list of 210 items used in this survey](:ref:Backstrom-1992-210a)). The list is missing five entries and shows also some further differences from the main list. Since we kept the numbering of both the standardized list and the concrete questionnaire used for the Balti dialects, those differences can be easily spotted when comparing the lists.	219-233	
Bowern-2012-644	Bowern, Claire	2012		644	questionnaire	English	Tasmanian		Bowern2012a		This list supplements a study on Tasmanian languages based on various sources. It provides a linking between different concept labels found in various sources on Tasmanian languages. Due to the specificity of the vocabulary, we had to leave many concepts unlinked.		
Bowern-2017-348	Bowern, Claire	2012		348	questionnaire	English	Pama-Nyungan	https://zenodo.org/record/1005671	Bowern2012b		This lists supplements [Bowern and Atkinson's (2012)](:bib:Bowern2012) study and contains material from both Swadesh's [200-item list](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and the [questionnaire for hunter gatherer languages](:ref:Bowern-2011-204).		
Kingsada-1999-303	Kingsada, Thongpheth and Shintani, Tadahiko	1999		303	basic	English	South-East Asia		Kingsada1999		This list was used for a survey of basic vocabulary of 17 language varieties spoken in the border region between China and Vietnam. The list itself references an earlier list by [Shintani and Yang (1990)](:bib:Shintani1990), which itself goes back to an even earlier larger list of concepts used for lexical field work of Chinese dialects. The last two lists are not yet available for the Concepticon, but we add the reference number in the column Shintani1990 (items with ID 999999 seem to indicate that this concept does not occur in the master list and was added for the survey).		
Calude-2011-200	Calude, Andreea S. and Pagel, Mark	2011		200	basic	English	cross-linguistic sample		Calude2011		This list is identical with the one by [Pagel et al. 2007](:ref:Pagel-2007-200), but it adds additional metadata, namely frequency counts for the 200 items for as many as 17 different languages. We list the logged frequencies of the basic words, leaving those cases where the authors did not find the respective word frequencies empty.		
BeijingDaxue-1964-905	{Beijing University}	1964		905	areal	Chinese	Chinese dialects		BeijingDaxue1964		This questionnaire was employed for one of the first large-scale dialect surveys in China, notably a survey that was based on lexical data, not solely on character readings. Unfortunately, the concepts themselves are very idiosyncratic and we had to omit many of those terms, as it would have been too tedious add them to the Concepticon right now.		Cihui
Daniels-2016-85	Daniels, Don	2016		85	basic,areal,documentation	English	New Guinea	http://muse.jhu.edu/article/619290	Daniels2016	Daniels2016	This list is supposed to reflect [Swadesh's concept list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), although it deviates from the original concept labels. It was used to compare a so far undocumented language from Papua New Guina (Magɨ) with a potentially related language (Aisi). Certain concepts were excluded from the list, mostly due to dependencies with other concepts due to colexification and compounding.	219-221	
Swadesh-1964-100	Swadesh, Morris	1964		100	basic	English,Russian	Global	http://www.classes.ru/grammar/148.new-in-linguistics-1/source/worddocuments/_24.htm	Swadesh1964		This is the famous [100 item Swadesh list](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) in the first Russian translation. This list contains the 92 most stable items from the [master list of 215 items](:ref:Swadesh-1960-215) plus eight additional items which are only mentioned in the text and are indicated here by starring the English concept label.	78-87	Swadesh-100-Russian
Swadesh-1960-215	Swadesh, Morris	1960		215	basic	Russian,English	Global	http://www.classes.ru/grammar/148.new-in-linguistics-1/source/worddocuments/_24.htm	Swadesh1964		This is the first Russian translation of the master list of [Swadesh's paper from 1955](:bib:Swadesh1955), which turned out to be very influential in Soviet linguistics and has retained influential up to today. Note that while the translation of the concept labels is literal and also provides the original ones which Swadesh provided in his c[master list of 215 concepts](:ref:Swadesh-1955-215), the Russian translation makes certain distinctions which cannot be determined from the original text. In one case, in the case of «fat», this distinction is essentially wrong, as Swadesh did explicitly annotate this concept as a body part or substance. The concepts whose English labels are preceded by an asterisk are those 92 concepts which were later included in the famous [100-item list](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100).	78-87	
Wilkins-1996-75	Wilkins, David P.	1996		75	body parts,specific	English	Global		Wilkins1996	Wilkins1996	This collection shows cross-linguistically frequent pathways of semantic change which involve one item of the [list of 41 body part terms](:ref:Wilkins-1996-41) by the same compiler. The network is displayed by showing to which *target* a given concept links, with multiple targets being separated by a comma.	284	Wilkins-75
Wilkins-1996-41	Wilkins, David P.	1996		41	body parts,specific	English	Global		Wilkins1996	Wilkins1996	This collection of body part concepts was used for a cross-linguistic study of semantic change.	271	Wilkins-41
Peiros-1999-100	Peiros, Ilia	1999		100	basic	English	Global		Peiros1999	Peiros1999	This list is supposed to reflect Swadesh's original [basic list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet it contains many additional specifications in the concept labels, which at times also differ from the concepts which Swadesh had originally in mind.	291	
Campbell-1999-100	Campbell, Lyle	1999		100	basic	English	Global		Campbell1999	Campbell1999	This list is supposed to replicate the standard list of [100 items by Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). It differs in the concept labels, however, and also in the ordering of concepts.	178	
Birchall-2016-125	Birchall, Joshua and Dunn, Michael and Greenhill, Simon J.	2016		125	areal	English	Chapacuran		Birchall2016		This list is the concept list underlying a comparative analysis of Chapacuran languages. The original data lists the concepts, but splits them into 285 cognate sets, occasionally allowing for variation in meaning. We ignored these variations and linked the concepts according to the basic meaning as further exemplified in the supplementary material of the study.		
Snoek-2013-61	Snoek, Conor	2013		61	body parts,specific	English	Athapaskan langauges		Snoek2013	Snoek2013	This concept list provides a list of general body part terms, including proper body parts, body liquids, and what the compiler calls ephemera, that is, alienable parts of the human body. The list is of specific interest as it is one of the rare explicit accounts we could find so far, where body part terminology is nearly exhaustively listed.	244	Snoek-body-parts
Wang-2015-62	Wang, Feng	2015		62	basic,stable	English,Chinese	Miao-Yao, Chinese		Wang2015		This list is supposed to represent a list of stable lexical items which are reflected in a larger range of Miao-Yao languages in form of regular sound correspondences in stable form-meaning relations.	170-175	
Matisoff-2009-47	Matisoff, James A.	2009		47	basic,stable	English	Tibeto-Burman	https://minpaku.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_uri&item_id=2578&file_id=18&file_no=1	Matisoff2009		This list proposes the most stable concepts for Tibeto-Burman, as reflected in reconstrutions with wide-spread reflexes. The concepts themselves are sometimes further broadened in the actual examples, showing complex patterns of semantic change that the author assumes. They are listed in the column REFLEX_MEANINGS in the data. The two personal pronouns are starred, as the author does not give the literal forms in the paper.	299-307	
Hooley-1971-128	Hooley, Bruce A.	1971		128	basic,areal	English	Austronesian		Hooley1971	Hooley1971	This list is based on [Bee (1962)](:bib:Bee1962), and it contains a selection of 128 of those original 176 words, due to the criterion of 'elicitability' in a field work survey. Further 28 items were discarded, since they did not find a word in the given varieties.	109-111	
Rea-1958-100	Rea, John A.	1958	1	100	basic	English	Romance languages		Rea1958	Rea1958	This list is basically identical with the list of [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and was used to test the stability of lexical items in the Romance languages.	148	
Mennecier-2016-183	Phillipe Mennecier and John Nerbonne and Evelyne Heyer and Franz Manni	2016		183	basic	English,Russian	Indo-Iranian,Turkic	https://figshare.com/articles/A_Central_Asian_Language_Survey/3443090/1	Mennecier2016		This concept list was underlying a study on Central Asian language varieties (Turkic and Indo-Iranian dialects). The data description is a bit confusing, as the authors list in their abstract that they used a [Swadesh list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) which they reduced to 176 items. In the supplementary table 1, they then mention that they excluded 21 of the 200 concepts, but they do not mention that they added to more concepts (AUTUMN and BUTTERFLY) in the table they show in supplementary material 1, and the total number of concepts expected in this table is also not 181, but 188, so they obviously used the [combined Swadesh list 207 items](:bib:Comrie1977). In the supplementary table 2, however, there are only 183 concepts, which we now list as such in our Concepticon. The column ENGLISH_1 corresponds to the summary table in supplementary table 1, from where we also took the Russian translations.		
Liu-2007-201	Liú, Lìlǐ 刘俐李 and Wáng, Hóngzhōng 王洪钟 and Bǎi, Yíng 柏莹	2007		201	basic	English,Chinese	Chinese dialects		Liu2007	Liu2007	This list is based on the [200 item list of Swadesh (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200). The reason why it contains 201 items is that the word for «RIVER» occurs twice, reflecting the two opposed terms *hé* and *jiāng*. Since these are merely regional terms both existing only in the cultural context of China, we link them to the same concept set. Nevertheless, the list still contains 201 items, as the item «count» in the data is listed both as a noun and a verb, with the noun then translating as «number». In Chinese dialects, the words for *number* and *count* are essentially the same, but they often show a difference in tone.	32-132	
Cysouw-2006-110	Cysouw, Michael and Wichmann, Søren and Kamholz, David	2006		110	basic	English	Mixe-Zoque		Cysouw2006		This list is almost completely identical with the original [110 item list by Starostin (1991)](:ref:Starostin-1991-110). It was used for a lexicostatistical investigation of 10 Mixe-Zoque languages.	259-261	
Deepadung-2015-100	Deepadung, Sujaritlak and Buakaw, Supakit and Rattanapitak, Ampika	2015		100	areal,basic	English	Palaung (Austroasiatic)	http://www.sealang.net/mks/mks44sujaritlak.pdf	Deepadung2015		This list consists of 100 items which were taken from the comparative basic list by [Mann (2004)](:ref:Mann-2004-500), consisting of 118 items which occur both in the list by [Matisoff (1978)](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200)the different lists of Swadesh ([1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), [1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200)). While this list contains 118 items, the authors only chose the first 100 of those.	33-38	
List-2016-57	List, Johann-Mattis	2016		57	areal,basic	English,Chinese	Chinese dialects		List2016f	List2016f	This list was created for an experiment on ancestral state reconstruction in Chinese dialects. It is originally based on a 200 concept list by [Wang (2006)](:ref:Wang-2006-200) and our version of the list shows the link to the original entries. The list is a collection of nouns which are all reconstructible back to Old Chinese, that is, following the annotation of the data provided in [Hamed and Wang (2006)](:bib:Hamed2006), the words expressing the concepts in Old Chinese have survived in at least one of the Chinese dialects in the same meaning.	129	
List-2016-180	List, Johann-Mattis	2016		180	areal,basic	English,Chinese	Chinese dialects		List2016g		This list was taken from the supplementary material of a study on partial cognate detection and comprises a larger concept lists, the [Hànyǔ Fāngyán Cíhuì](:bib:Cihui] (1964), consisting of about 800 concepts which were translated into 18 dialect varieties. The smaller list of 180 concepts was selected with respect to the relative frequency of the concepts in other datasets. While the authors link to our Concepticon in their original publication, we re-adjusted some of their links, as it turned out they were either ambiguous or not precise enough. Thus, we linked «left» to «LEFT HAND», as the Chinese concept label in the original source and the dialect words suggest this reading. We also added information on the page number and the identification number in the original source of the Cíhuì.		
Heggarty-2014-110	Heggarty, Paul	2014		110	areal,stable	English	Germanic	http://alignments.lingpy.org/multiple.php?dataset=Germanic	List2014e		This list was originally proposed by Paul Heggarty to reflect the most stable words across Germanic languages and is now used in the [Sound Comparisons Projects](http://soundcomparisons.com/). The data for a couple of Germanic language varieties was further included in the [Benchmark Database of Phonetic Alignments](http://alignments.lingpy.org), from which we took the list we present here.		
Chacon-2014-142	Chacon, Thiago Costa	2014		142	areal	English	Tukano		Chacon2014		This list was underlying a detailed reconstruction of the consonant system of Proto-Tukano. The items in the list were selected for reasons of coverage in terms of cognate reflexes in the Tukanoan languages under investigation. The list was not officially published but kindly provided to us by the author.		
Kessler-2001-200	Kessler, Brett	2001		200	basic	English	global		Kessler2001		This list was used to test various methods for the proof of language relationship. It is supposed to follow strictly the [200-item list of Swadesh (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200).	202-258	
Gregersen-1976-217	Gregersen, Edgar A.	1976		217	basic	English	African		Gregersen1976	Gregersen1976	This concept list is based on a merger of several concept lists proposed by Swadesh. As the compiler mentions himself, the list is composed of all 200 items proposed in [Swadesh (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), all additional items proposed in [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), and [Swadeshs supplementary list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1960-100a). According to the annotation of the compiler, all items occuring in the 200-item list and the 100-item list are marked with one asterisk. All items occuring only in the 100-item list are marked with two asterisks, and all items makred with a preceding dash (—) occur only in the supplementary list.	110-116	
Sato-2002-200	Sato, Tomomi	2002		200	areal,documentation	English	Ainu	http://hdl.handle.net/2115/34009	Sato2002	Sato2002	This list was taken from an article which cites basic vocabulary items from the Ainu dialect of Samani. It is not clear on which criteria the author selected the meaning list. He quotes work of Shirō Hattori ([1961](:bib:Hattori1961)), and lists data presented in an earlier dictionary compiled by Hattori, but it is not clear whether the selection of meanings was also based on previous work.	99-114	
Lee-2013-200	Lee, S. and Hasegawa, Toshiharu	2013		200	basic	English,Japanese	Ainu		Lee2013		This list was used to study the evolution of the Ainu languages. It is almost completely identical with the list of [200 items by Hattori (1973)](:ref:Hattori-1973-200), but contains additional Japanese translations. The first author was so friendly to provide us with the concept list in digital form.		
Swadesh-1954-97	Swadesh, Morris	1954		97	basic	English	American Indian languages		Swadesh1954	Swadesh1954	According to Swadesh, this list of 97 items was extracted from a larger collection of 120 wordlists in American Indian languages. The 97 items which Swadesh labeled as «non-cultural» seem to be a compromise between coverage and useful items for language comparison, which would also explain the rather strange number of 97 concepts.	316-318	
Brinton-1891-21	Brinton, Daniel G.	1891		21	ultra-stable	English	American languages	https://archive.org/details/americanraceali01bringoog	Brinton1891	Brinton1891	This list of 21 items was used as a means to compare basic characteristics of different indigeneous languages of America.	336	
Heggarty-2005-30a	Heggarty, Paul	2005	a	30	hihi	English	Andean		McMahon2005	McMahon2005	This is what [McMahon and McMahon (2005)](:bib:McMahon2005) call a «hihi» list for Andean languages, that is, a list high in «reconstructability» and high in «retentiveness». So the items are supposed to be among the most stable concepts that can be found in the Andean languages.	171	
Heggarty-2005-30b	Heggarty, Paul	2005	b	30	lolo	English	Andean		McMahon2005	McMahon2005	This is what [McMahon and McMahon (2005)](:bib:McMahon2005) call a «lolo» list for Andean languages, that is, a list low in «reconstructability» and low in «retentiveness». So the items are supposed to be among the less stable concepts that can be found in the original lexicostatistical database of Andean languages.	171	
Payne-1991-202	Payne, David L.	1991		202	specific	English	Arawakan		Payne1991	Payne1991	This concept list is extracted from a collection of lexical reconstructions of Proto-Arawakan along with their reflexes in 24 Arawakan languages. The concept labels are not always easy to interprete. The author mentions that labels in brackets result from meaning deviations in some of the reflexes, but this principle does not seem to have been followed up thoroughly all the time.	392-426	
Pozdniakov-2014-100b	Pozdniakov, Konstantin	2014	b	100	ranked	English	Atlantic	http://jolr.ru/files/(144)jlr2014-11(187-237).pdf	Pozdniakov2014	Pozdniakov2014	This list presents stability ranks for the Atlantic languages by using a modified version of the ranking procedure proposed by [Starostin (2007)](:bib:Starostin2007). In contrast to the original ranking procedure, the results are calculated by averaging them. The Atlantic language data underlying the ranking covers etymological data for 41 different languages. Since we know that the concept labels in this list are meant to denote the same concepts as those presented in the list by [Starostin (2007)](:ref:Starostin-2007-110), there are some mappings which may seem unintuitive («ground» being mapped to «EARTH (SOIL)»), since they result from different translations from the Russian source into English.  202	200	
Alpher-1999-151	Alpher, Barry and Nash, David	1999		151	areal	English	Australian		Alpher1999	Alpher1999	This list was originally proposed in order to carry out lexicostatistical studies of Australian languages. The first 100 words constitute the list of [O'Grady and Klokeid in 1969](:ref:OGrady-1969-100); the next 20 are the words in Hale's (1961) list that are not also in O'Grady and Klokeid's; the next 25 are words in Black's (nd a.) list that are not in either of the above; the last 6 words (relevant for the most part in the monsoon tropics of Australia) are the authors' additions.	53-55	
Hale-1961-100	Hale, Kenneth L.	1961		100	areal	English	Australian		Alpher1999	Alpher1999	According to [Alpher and Nash (1999)](:bib:Alpher1999), this list has been created by K. Hale and is reflected in an unpublished resource from 1961.		
OGrady-1969-100	O'Grady, Geoffrey N. and Klokeid, Terry J.	1969		100	areal	English	Australian		OGrady1969	OGrady1969	This is one of the earlier lists proposed for comparative studies on Australian languages. It was later used as the basis of the [151 item list by Alpher and Nash (1999)](:ref:Alpher-1999-151).	303-307	
Sidwell-2015-200	Sidwell, Paul	2015		200	areal	English	Austroasiatic	http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.34092	Sidwell2015	Sidwell2015	This list was compiled for the purpose of lexicostatistical comparison of Austroasiatic languages. The list is essentially a merger of the classical lists of Swadesh ([1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100)) and Matisoff ([1978](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200)), though it does not follow any of them completely. Sidwell provides a comparison of his own list with the two classical lists by Swadesh, which is indicated in the additional columns.	lxxv-lxxvi	
Blust-2008-210	Blust, Robert	2008		210	areal	English	Austronesian	https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/austronesian/word.php	Greenhill2008	Greenhill2008	This is the 210 item concept list which is used in the [Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database](https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/austronesian/).	274	
Blust-1981-200	Blust, Robert	1981		200	basic	English	Austronesian		Blust1981		This is the first version of Blust's modified list for lexicostatistical comparison which would later become the [210 item list](:ref:Blust-2008-210) of the [ABVD]() project. The list is mentioned in [Blust (2000)](:bib:Blust2000) yet it is not printed there, and it was prepared as a manuscript that was presented at a conference in 1981 but was never published. Robert Blust was so friendly to provide us with a digital version of his original list.		
Thomas-1979-34	Thomas, David	1979		34	areal	English	Bahnaric		Thomas1979	Thomas1979	This list contains words which are useful for the subgrouping of Bahnaric, since the main branches show divergent vocabulary items in these cases.	174-177	
Allen-2007-500	Allen, Brian	2007		500	questionnaire	English, Chinese	Bai		Allen2007		This list was taken as the reference for conducting field work on the Bai dialects, a minority language spoken in South-West China. Originally, 550 words were collected, but due to missing items in some of the languages of the survey, the list was further reduced to 500 languages.	69-113	
Bennett-1976-100	Bennett, Patrick R.	1976		100	areal	English	Bantu		Bennet1976		This list was created to carry out lexicostatistical studies of Bantu languages. Originally, it is divided into two parts, one for nouns ([163-165](:ref:Bennett-1976-50a)) and one for verbs ([166f](:ref:Bennett-1976-50b)). Here, we list both parts together.	163-167	
Bennett-1976-50a	Bennett, Patrick R.	1976	a	50	areal	English	Bantu		Bennet1976		This list was created to carry out lexicostatistical studies of Bantu languages. This subset of the [complete list](:ref:Bennett-1976-100) contains only nouns.	163-165	
Bennett-1976-50b	Bennett, Patrick R.	1976	b	50	areal	English	Bantu		Bennet1976		This list was created to carry out lexicostatistical studies of Bantu languages. This subset of the [complete list](:ref:Bennett-1976-100) contains only verbs.	166f	
Grollemund-2015-100	Grollemund, Rebecca and Branford, Simon and Bostoen, Koen and Meade, Andrew and Venditti, Chris and Pagel, Mark	2015		100	basic	English, French	Bantu	http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2015/09/10/1503793112.DCSupplemental/pnas.1503793112.sd01.xlsx	Grollemund2015		This list contains 100 concept labels which are quite different from traditionally used lists based on the first concept lists produced by Swadesh ([1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and [1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200). The concept list itself is not given in the article but provided in the supplementary material.		
TeilDautrey-2008-430	Teil-Dautrey, Gisèle	2008		430	questionnaire	English	Bantu	https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/bantu/	Greenhill2008	Greenhill2008	The numbering of the concept list indicates 434 concepts in total. However, in our count and in the count on the website, only 430 items seem to have been defined. To our knowledge, there is no printed publication of the list of concepts. When mapping the concepts to the concepticon, we hade some problems in finding the correct mapping for quite a few concepts. So until we have carried out a proper re-checking of the data, asking the original authors of the concept list for help, the results of this mapping should be taken with a considerable amount of care. Since the [BBVD](https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/bantu/) was launched around the first time the [ABVD](https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/austronesian/) was launched, we assign this source the same year in the reference as we assigned the [ABVD](https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/austronesian/).		
Ogden-1930-100	Ogden, Charles Kay	1930		100	basic	English	Basic English	http://www2.educ.fukushima-u.ac.jp/~ryota/word-list.html	Ogden1930		This is the «operational» part of Ogden's 850 words of Basic English, and we add it in addition to the [picturable part](:ref:Ogden-1930-200). Note that we failed to link quite a few of the words since they are not easy to be understood as concepts but rather as function words. Feel free to suggest revisions if you are not content with our current linking.		
Ogden-1930-200	Ogden, Charles Kay	1930		200	basic	English	Basic English	https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Basic_English_picture_wordlist	Ogden1930		This is but one part of the famous 850 words of Ogden's «Basic English», which was intended to present a way to simplify English serving as a lingua franca. The original source could, unfortunately not be obtained, and so we only list 200 of the 850 words by Ogden, which we find interesting, since the author labelled them as «picturable words», thus these words are supposed to be very concrete, and we provide additional links to representative images taking from the Simple English version of Wikipedia. Note that not all of the 200 words are listed on this page, with two words missing, so we added them and marked them by an asterisk to annotate that the image links do not originally stem from the page we give in the URL.		
Forni-2013-201	Forni, Gianfranco	2013		201	stable	English,Basque	Basque,Indo-European		Forni2013	Forni2013	This list is supposed to represent non-borrowed parts of Basque basic vocabulary. Since the list itself was based on reconstructions of Proto-Basque, it contains rather fuzzy concept labels which were not easy to resolve. To our knowledge, the list was created independently of any alternative work on concept lists, like, e.g., the work by Morris Swadesh.	98-103	
Mitterhofer-2013-95	Mitterhofer, Bernadette	2013		95	areal	English	Bena dialects		Mitterhofer2013	Mitterhofer2013	This is the short concept list used for a dialect survey of Bena dialects. Note that two items of the list are labeled as *a* and *b* respectively, which is why the real number of concept labels is not 94 but 95 items. Compare also the [long list of 300 items](:ref:Mitterhofer-2013-300) which partially overlaps with this short list, and the [combined list of 355 items](:ref:Mitterhofer-2013-355) by the same author.	81-105	Mitterhofer-2013-94
Mitterhofer-2013-355	Mitterhofer, Bernadette	2013		355	questionnaire	English	Bena dialects		Mitterhofer2013	Mitterhofer2013	This is the combined concept list used for a dialect survey of Bena dialects. It is the merger of two separate concept list, one [long list of 300 items](:ref:Mitterhofer-2013-300), and one [short list of 95 items](:ref:Mitterhofer-2013-355) by the same author.	81-105	
Mitterhofer-2013-300	Mitterhofer, Bernadette	2013		300	questionnaire	English	Bena dialects		Mitterhofer2013	Mitterhofer2013	This is the long concept list used for a dialect survey of Bena dialects. Note that two items of the list are labeled as *a* and *b* respectively, which is why the real number of concept labels is not 94 but 95 items. Compare also the [short list of 95 items](:ref:Mitterhofer-2013-95) which partially overlaps with this long list, and the [combined list of 355 items](:ref:Mitterhofer-2013-355) by the same author.	81-105	
Luqman-2010-65	Luqman, Hirzi	2010		65	areal	English	Bornean (Austronesian)		Luqman2010	Luqman2010	This concept list consists of a small selection of the [Austronesian Basic Vocabulary List](:ref:Blust-2008-210). The compiler lists different reasons for shortening the list for his phylogenetic study on Bornean languages, like *resistance to borrowing*, *distinctness of the meaning*, and gaps in the data. The compiler states that there are 64 items in the data and counts them accordingly. However, there is a counting error, since the item whith the number 27 is missing in the second table of the appendix. Judging from the first table, it should be «mother». Furthermore, the item «Tongue» is listed in the second table, but not in the first one, while «grass», listed in the first table, does not occur in the second one. We marked these three cases of inconsistencies with an asterisk in the gloss.	A2f	
Mann-1998-406	Mann, Noel Walter	1998		406	areal,questionnaire	English	Burmish languages		Mann1998	Mann1998	This list was used to reconstruct Proto-North-Western Burmish, based on a comparison of several Burmish languages. The concept list itself is a 406 item list that was apparently created by the [SIL](http://sil.org) project as a specificic concept list for South-East Asia. This list itself exists in different versions, with the most recent one consisting of [436 items](:ref:SIL-2002-436). This latest list, however, is essentially identical with the earlier 406 item list, with only 30 additional concepts added in the end. Mann's concept list of 406 items is not complete, since he did not find forms for all of the words in the Burmish languages. Those forms are marked with an asterisk in our representation.	126-133	
Kraft-1981-434	Kraft, Charles H.	1981		434	questionnaire	English, Hausa	Chadic		Kraft1981	Kraft1981	A large conceptlist of 434 basic concepts compiled for the study of Chadic languages.	01. Jun	
Lin-2010-89	Lín, Tiānsòng 林天送 and Fàn, Yíng 范莹	2010		89	areal	Chinese, English	Chinese		Lin2010	Lin2010	This is a shortened version of the 100-item list by [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). Serving as a basis for a lexicostatistical study of 16 Mǐn dialects, the author discarded 11 items («all» 全部, «bark» 樹皮, «hair» 頭髮, «hair», «knee» 膝蓋, «neck» 脖子, «swim» 游泳, «we» 我們, «what» 設么, «who» 誰, «man» 男人, and «woman» 女人), for the reason that these words had the tendency to belong to borrowed layers in the dialects.	667-669	
Zheng-2007-86	Zhēng, Chūnlán 郑春兰	2007		86	areal	Chinese	Chinese		Zheng2007	Zheng2007	This is conceptlist was used to study basic words in the Oracle Bone inscriptions. The wordlist itself is originally based on the list by [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), but the author discarded the function words in the analysis and used also certain translations which diverge from the concepts originally proposed by Swadesh. Thus, instead of «to know» Zhēng uses «to understand» (Chinese *dǒng* 懂), and Chinese *rè* 熱 is better translated as «hot» than as «warm». In addition, Zhēng also offers semantic categories for the 86 concepts.	68	
Norman-2003-40	Norman, Jerry	2003		40	areal	English, Chinese	Chinese		Norman2003	Norman2003	This list of 40 items was proposed as a diagnostic test list to check whether a language belongs to the group of Sinitic languages or not. Note that what is labelled as «common chinese» in the list is a reconstruction system similar to that of Middle Chinese, but -- according to J. Norman -- less biased by the character readings of the traditional rhyme dictionaries published around 600 AD.	74f	
Wang-2006-200	Wang, Feng	2006		200	basic	Chinese, English	Chinese		Hamed2006		This is a very close rendering of [Swadesh's traditional list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), yet since it was designed as a testlist for Chinese dialects, there are some slight deviations from the original (compare, for example, the items for «hot», but also «dull» which is erroneously translated as «stupid»). Note that the data itself does not appear in any source, but was kindly provided by one of the authors.		
Hou-2004-180	Hóu, Jīngyī 侯精一	2004		180	questionnaire	Chinese	Chinese		Hou2004		This list is used as a basic concept list for a survey of 40 Chinese dialect varieties.		
Wang-2004-200	Wang, Feng and Wang, Shi Yuan William	2004		200	basic	English,Chinese	Chinese dialects		Wang2004	Wang2004	This basic list of 200 items is supposed to be identical with the [200-item list by Swadesh (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), but it is more likely that it is taken from the list by [Chen (1996)](:ref:Chen-1996-200), since the compiles explicitly refer to Chen's work and also translate «dull» as «stupid» in the Chinese list. They also follow Chen's ranking procedure by which the list is split into two parts, one of [low stability](:ref:Wang-2004-100b) and one of [high stability](:ref:Wang-2004-100a). For the application of the list to the Chinese dialects, the compilors further reduce the stable list to a [list of 95 items](:ref:Wang-2004-95.tsv), based on a morphological criterion by which no compound words should occur in the data.	655f	
Wang-2004-95	Wang, Feng and Wang, Shi Yuan William	2004	b	200	basic,areal	English,Chinese	Chinese dialects		Wang2004	Wang2004	This is the stable sublist of a basic list of [200 items](:ref:Wang-2004-200) which was further reduced to 95 items, following a morphological criterion, according to which no compound words should occur in concept lists for language classification.	655f	
Wang-2004-100a	Wang, Feng and Wang, Shi Yuan William	2004	a	200	stable	English,Chinese	Chinese dialects		Wang2004	Wang2004	This is stable sublist of a basic list of [200 items](:ref:Wang-2004-200). The basic 200-item list is supposed to be identical with the [200-item list by Swadesh (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), but it is more likely that it is taken from the list by [Chen (1996)](:ref:Chen-1996-200), since the compilers explicitly refer to Chen's work and also translate «dull» as «stupid» in the Chinese list. For the application of the stable list to the Chinese dialects, the compilors further reduce the stable list to a [list of 95 items](:ref:Wang-2004-95.tsv), based on a morphological criterion by which no compound words should occur in the data.	655f	
Wang-2004-100b	Wang, Feng and Wang, Shi Yuan William	2004	b	200	unstable	English,Chinese	Chinese dialects		Wang2004	Wang2004	This is the unstable sublist of a basic list of [200 items](:ref:Wang-2004-200). The basic 200-item list is supposed to be identical with the [200-item list by Swadesh (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), but it is more likely that it is taken from the list by [Chen (1996)](:ref:Chen-1996-200), since the compiles explicitly refer to Chen's work and also translate «dull» as «stupid» in the Chinese list.	655f	
He-2010-207	Hé, Yǔyīn 何宇茵 and Mǎ, Sài 马赛	2010		207	basic, sign language	Chinese	Chinese sign languages		He2010	He2010	According to the authors, this list of 207 items stems directly from Morris Swadesh's work. However, since Swadesh himself never published a list of 207 items, it is more likely that they took the 207 items from one of those compilers who merged Swadesh's lists of [100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and [200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), such as, for example, the early list by [Comrie (1977)](:ref:Comrie-1977-207). In their paper, the authors investigate the iconicity of basic concepts in Chinese sign language. They distinguish three different degrees of iconicity: «strong» «weak» and «no» inonicity.	56	
Chen-1996-200	Chén, Bǎoyà 陈保亚	1996		200	basic	Chinese	Chinese, Tai		Chen1996	Chen1996	This is the full concept list proposed by Chén, slightly modified from the originial [concept list of 200 items by Swadesh](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200).	295-297	
Chen-1996-100a	Chén, Bǎoyà 陈保亚	1996	a	100	stable	Chinese	Chinese, Tai		Chen1996	Chen1996	This is the supposedly stable part of a concept list, slightly modified from Swadesh's originial [concept list of 200 Items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200).	295f	
Chen-1996-100b	Chén, Bǎoyà 陈保亚	1996	b	100	unstable	Chinese	Chinese, Tai		Chen1996	Chen1996	This is the supposedly less stable part of the concept list, slightly modified from Swadesh's originial [concept list of 200 Items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200).	296f	
Nicholas-1989-60	Nicholas, Linda E. and Brookshire, Robert H. and MacLennan, Donald L. and Schumacher, James G. and Porrazzo, Shirley A.	1989		60	naming test,ranked	English	English	http://aphasiology.pitt.edu/archive/00000069/	Nicholas1989	Nicholas1989	This list presents the [Boston Naming Test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Naming_Test) which was developed in 1983 in order to assess the degree of aphasia or language disturbance cased by various diseases in neurology. The original publication itself is difficult to asses, as are the 60 items, but in this publicaton, the authors list all 60 concepts. Unfortunately we lack the images, which are usually given along with naming tests, so it was not possible to determine for all of the concepts, which one was actually meant, and we left these unlinked.

Wichmann-2010-40	Wichmann, Søren and Holman, Eric W. and Brown, Cecil H.	2010		40	annotated	English	Global		Wichmann2010	Wichmann2010	This list contains rankings for the degree to wich any of the 40 items of the [basic list of the ASJP project](:ref:Holman-2008-40) could be influenced by sound symbolism. The scores are based on an automatic investigation of the data of the [ASJP project](http://asjp.clld.org). Column *D* shows the amount of sound symbolism inferred for the concept. Column *S* shows the tendency of words to be cognate with words in closely related languages. Column *shape* shows the typical shape of a word in this meaning slot aggregated from the data.	854	
List-2014-1280	List, Johann-Mattis and Mayer, Thomas and Terhalle, Anselm and Urban, Matthias	2014		1280	annotated, relations, ranked	English	Global	http://clics.lingpy.org	List2014		This is the concept list underlying the [Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications (CLICS)](http://clics.lingpy.org). This list is a subset of the concept list underlying the [Intercontinental Dictionary Series](:ref:Key-2016-1310) and it offers an extended colexification analysis of all data underlying the 2007 version of the IDS along with data from different sources. Instead of providing full graphs for the networks, we provide links to the major clusters for each concept in CLICS. CLICS distinguishes two different kinds of cluster analyses: a community analysis, which can be accessed via the link in the ``CLUSTER_URL`` column, and a subgraph analysis, which can be accessed via the link in the ``SUBGRAPH_URL`` column. The column ``COMMUNITY_LABEL`` list the most central node in each of the community clusters in CLICS. The column ``FREQUENCY`` lists the number of times a translation for a given concept occurs in the CLICS data, and the columns ``DEGREE`` and ``WEIGHTED_DEGREE`` contains the unweighted and weighted degree for each node, the former referring to the number of concepts to which a given concept links, and the latter to the number of languages in which the concept links to any other concept.		
Urban-2011-160	Urban, Matthias	2011		160	annotated	English	Global		Urban2011	Urban2011	This list was created for the purpose of investigating directional aspects of semantic change patterns by investigating patterns of colexification an overt marking in a large sample of languages. The concept list itself is inspired by the list of the [Intercontinental Dictionary Series](:ref:Key-2016-1310) and the list of the [World Loanword Database](:ref:Haspelmath-2009-1460), but contains additional items which cannot be found on either of the two concept lists. The compiler lists findings regarding directed patterns of semantic change by providing source and target concept as well as the number of colexifications and the number of overtly marked cases. These patterns (a total of 47) are provided in the column ``SEMANTIC CHANGE``, where we list the number of the pattern in the source in square brackets, the source and the target concept, and the number of colexifications and overtly marked cases in normal brackets.	9-13, 46f	
Borin-2015-1532	Borin, Lars	2015		1532	annotated	English	Global	http://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/resource/lwt-pwn	Borin2013		This list is basically identical with the concept list used in the [Intercontinental Dictionary Series](:ref:Key-2016-1310), yet it contains an additional mapping to the [Princeton Wordnet](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn) provided by the compiler. It thus defines additional metadata that may be useful for different purposes. Note that the linking to the Princeton Wordnet is not unique, but *one to many*: One concept of the original concept list may be linked to multiple senses of the Princeton Wordnet. The additional columns give the identifier used in the Intercontinental Dictionary Series (IDS_KEY), the Princeton Wordnet Word Sense (PWN_WORD_SENSE), the definition of the Princeton Wordnet (PWN_DEFINITION). As additional links which may turn out to be useful, we added the corresponding synsets of the Princeton Wordnet (PWN_SYNSET), the part of speech as defined for the synset by the Princeton Wordnet, and a weblink to the [Open Multilingual Wordnet](http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/) (OMW_URL).

Kassian-2010-116	Kassian, Alexei and Starostin, George S. and Dybo, A. and Chernov, V.	2010		116	annotated	English, Russian	Global		Kassian2010	Kassian2010	This is an attempt by the authors to further specify the meanings of concept lists for the purpose of language comparison. They take the list of [Starostin 1991](:ref:Starostin-1991-110) as a basis, which is itself a merger of the concept list proposed by [Sergej Yakhontov](:ref:Yakhontov-1991-100) and the 100-item list proposed by [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). This lists contains a total of 116 items, since the authors subdivided certain parts of the 110-item list in order to get a more precise definition of the concepts. Thus, the authors clearly distinguish between different kinds of «thin», depending on the shape of the object (be it flat or long).	51-89	
Bulakh-2013-870	Bulakh, Maria and Ganenkov, Dimitrij and Gruntov, Ilya and Maisak, Timur and Rousseau, Maxim and Zalizniak, Anna A.	2013		870	annotated	English	Global		Zalizniak2012,Bulakh2013		This is a small subset of the most frequent concepts in the [Database of semantic shifts in the languages of the world (DatSemShifts)](http://semshifts.iling-ran.ru). The list was created by extracting all concepts occuring three or more times within a sourc-target-relation in the database. The original number of concepts is rather large (we counted as many as 2424 distinct glosses). In selecting only a subset of these, we hope to reduce the number of more or less identical concepts which are assigned different glosses and IDs in the database.		DatSemShifts
Mann-2004-210	Mann, Noel Walter	2004		210	areal	English	Global	http://li.payap.ac.th/images/stories/survey/Mann%20(2004)%20(MSEA%20Comparative%20Wordlist).pdf	Mann2004	Mann2004	This list contains those elements which -- according to the analysis of the compiler -- occur in the alternative conceptlist by Matisoff ([1978](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200)). Although Mann himself writes that this list contains 209 items, we could find 210 items in the first representation which he published. The difference is due to the concept «you (plural)» which originally does not occur in Matisoff's list but is included in the big [comparative list of Mann](:ref:Mann-2004-500) as an item that appears on Matisoff's list.

Trask-1996-207	Trask, Robert L.	1996		207	basic	English	Global		Trask1996	Trask1996	According to the author, this list is taken from [Gudschinsky (1956)](:ref:Gudschinsky-1956-200), but since Gudschinsky only has 200 items, the lists are not completely identical, and it seems more that it follows [Comrie's merger of the two Swadesh lists](:ref:Comrie-1977-207) which was, to our knowledge, the first list that merged the [first](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and [second](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) list of Swadesh (1952, 1955) to 207 items. This list is presented in a introductory textbook for historical linguistics as an example for the method of glottochronology and lexicostatistics. The words of the [100 item list](:ref:Trask-1996-100) in the same book, taken from Swadesh (1955), are given in bold face in the text, and in starred form in our source.	408f	
Trask-1996-100	Trask, Robert L.	1996		100	basic	English	Global		Trask1996	Trask1996	This is the authors version of [Swadesh's list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), presented in a introductory textbook for historical linguistics as an example for the method of glottochronology and lexicostatistics.	373f	
Ringe-1992-100	Ringe, Donald	1992		100	basic	English	Global		Ringe1992	Ringe1992	This list is supposed to mirror the [100-item list by Swadesh (1955)] completely. It was used to test to which degree it is possible to calculate the factor of chance in language comparison. The list is, however, not completely identical with the original, since the compiler adds closer annotations to the semantic glosses, which at times also diverge from the original 100-item list. Thus «burn» is labelled as *transitive* in Swadesh's original list, but labelled as *intransitive* by Ringe.	83-85	
Mann-2004-209	Mann, Noel Walter	2004		209	basic	English	Global	http://li.payap.ac.th/images/stories/survey/Mann%20(2004)%20(MSEA%20Comparative%20Wordlist).pdf	Mann2004	Mann2004	This list contains those elements which -- according to the analysis of the compiler -- occur in the union of both lists proposed by Swadesh ([1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). Although Mann himself writes that this list contains 210 items, we could only find 209 items in both representations which he published. The difference in contrast to the «traditional» accounts which list [207 items](:ref:Comrie-1977-207) is that Mann counts certain concepts differently. Thus, he counts «grease» and «fat (nount)» as different concepts.	Mar 13

The author further add semantic field descriptions of the 100 items in an ad-hoc manner.	7	
Comrie-1977-207	Comrie, Bernard and Smith, N.	1977		207	basic	English	Global	https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/tools-at-lingboard/questionnaire/linguaQ.php	Comrie1977		Judging from the number of items, it is clear that this list is a merger of the two concept lists proposed by Swadesh in [1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). There are, however, some deviations from Swadesh's original concept labels, and these again show that the list of [Gudschinsky (1956)](:ref:Gudschinsky-1956-200) may have served as the base list for 200 of the 207 items. Since the list appears in an influential questionnaire for linguistic fieldwork, it can be expected that the impact of this list on fieldworkers was much higher than the impact of the original concept lists proposed by Swadesh.

Bowern-2008-207	Bowern, Claire	2008		207	basic	English	Global	http://pamanyungan.sites.yale.edu/sites/default/files/SwadeshSemField.pdf	Bowern2008	Bowern2008	In the supplementary material to her practical guide on fieldwork, Bowern offers a concept list which is organized by semantic fields. In the book, a normal concept list is given, which is, according to the compiler, taken from [the list by Comrie and Smith](:ref:Comrie-1977-207), although it contains a small amount of modifications. Here, we show only the online list, not the list in the book, since the semantic field ordering seems to be more interesting than the raw listing of concept labels.	35f, 223f	
Swadesh-1971-100	Swadesh, Morris	1971		100	basic	English	Global		Swadesh1971	Swadesh1971	This is a post-humously published 100-item list by Morris Swadesh. Basically, it is identical with the one published in [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet the labels in this list are simplified and not completely identical with the ones proposed before. In the version we consulted, some items seem to have been written in italic font, although we couldn't find any general pattern, what this practice might hint to. In order to keep as closely to the original, however, we marked all those entries with an asterisk.	273	
Wiktionary-2003-207	Wiktionary	2003		207	basic	English	Global	http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Swadesh_lists	Wiktionary, Swadesh1952, Swadesh1955		As far as it is possible to follow the editing history of the [Wiktionary project](http://en.wiktionary.org), it seems that this concept list was first proposed in 2003. It was supposed to be a pure merger of the concepts which Swadesh proposed in [1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). However, the editors did not notice (or deliberately ignored) that the former list explicitly lists the intransitive form of «to burn», while the latter lists «to burn» as transitive. Similar problems hold for «rain» which is explicitly labelled as a verb in the 200 item list, while no further specification is given in the 100 item list. One may of course say that these differences are minor ones, yet as a comparison with alternative approaches using the classical «Swadesh list» show, the incomplete descriptions of glosses have lead to a rather great degree of fuzziness in the application of concept lists for the purpose of language comparison.		
Gudschinsky-1956-200	Gudschinsky, Sarah C.	1956		200	basic	English	Global		Gudschinsky1956	Gudschinsky1956	Although the compiler of this list claims that this list reflects the original [Swadesh-list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), it contains in fact some deviations. For example, Gudschinsky introduces dashed labels (like «fat-grease») in those cases where Swadesh had put one of the items in brackets (like «fat (grease)»). This practice has led to some confusion in later work by scholars who would claim to use Swadesh's list of 200 items but who were in fact only referring to Gudschinsky's list.	186-200	
Samarin-1967-218	Samarin, William J.	1967		218	basic	English	Global		Samarin1967	Samarin1967	As the compiler of this concept list notes, the reason why there are 218 concepts for what the compiler himself calls a 200-word list, is that the list is a «conflation of [Swadesh 1955](:bib:Swadesh1955) (where the words are listed both by semantic groups and alphabetically) and [Gudschinsky 1956](:bib:Gudschinsky1956a).» In the list, those items which are missing in Gudschinsky are marked with an asterisk. As the original source suggests, the list is intended to serve as a starting point for field work. The compiler of the list seems to be indifferent regarding the validity of lexicostatistics, but deems the word lists quite useful for comparison with other resources. In the study, the author also presents a [100-item list](:ref:Samarin-1967-100) which is given in a more detailed form along with additional translations into French, Spanish, and German.	220	
Holman-2008-100	Holman, Eric W. and Wichmann, Søren and Brown, Cecil H. and Velupillai, Viveka and Müller, Andreas and Bakker, Dik	2008		100	basic	English	Global	http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Soren_Wichmann/publication/40853552_Explorations_in_automated_language_classification/links/09e41508a4943d4255000000.pdf	Holman2008	Holman2008	This list contains 100 items which are drawn from [Swadesh's list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) in ranked order. The compilers of this ranked list later extracted a [list of 40 items](:ref:Holman-2008-40) to become the basic concept list of the [ASJP project](http://asjp.clld.org). In this list, these items are marked with an asterisk.	27-30	
Swadesh-1960-100a	Swadesh, Morris	1960	a	100	basic	English	Global		Hymes1960	Hymes1960	The source labels this list as Swadesh's standard list of 100 items, so it should be identical with the [one he published in 1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). However, the concept labels differ to some degree. Be it for reasons of space or for other reasons unknown to us, all additional information of the labels was removed, thus making it impossible to distinguish, for example, whether «burn» is aiming at the transitive or the intransitive version of the concept. Similar confusion is created by items like «flesh» (is it human, animal, serving as food, or referring to the substance of living creatures?), and «rain» (verb or noun?), which actually also occurs on the [second, supposedly less stable list](:ref:Swadesh-1960-100b) also attributed to Swadesh and reported in the same source.	6	
Swadesh-1960-200	Swadesh, Morris	1960		100	basic	English	Global		Hymes1960	Hymes1960	According to the source, this list should be equivalent with Swadesh's [list of 200 items from 1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200). This is, however, not the case, since the list differs greatly in the labels for the glosses originally used by Swadesh. Given the idiosyncratic structure of labeling which uses dash-symbols to label concepts with help of two glosses (e.g., «hold-take», «meat-flesh»), it is much more likely that the source would use the [version published by Gudschinsky](:ref:Gudschinsky-1956-200). It is, not exactly identical with Gudschinsky's version of Swadesh's list of 200 items, since it uses slightly different concept labels in which, for example, question marks for interrogatives are omitted. In the mapping to our Concepticon, however, these minor modifications in the labels do not show up and all items are mapped to the same concept. We add it in our collection in order to illustrate how easily changes have been propagated in the history of concept list compilation.	6	
Swadesh-1950-215	Swadesh, Morris	1950		215	basic	English	Global		Swadesh1950	Swadesh1950	The first list which was proposed by Swadesh. He never applied it to the Salish language, since there was not enough data to translate the items into all Salish languages, but this was the initial list which Swadesh had envisioned. Note that in the original text, there is a spelling error, pointing to 225 items, although the actual number of items directly mentioned by Swadesh sums up to only 215.	161

The list itself is a merger of [Swadesh's 100-item list](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and [Yakhontov's 100-item list](:ref:Yakhontov-1991-100).

Swadesh-1955-100	Swadesh, Morris	1955		100	basic	English	Global		Swadesh1955	Swadesh1955	Swadesh's most famous concept list of 100 items. The original article lists all 215 items originally proposed in the first article on [lexicostatistics in 1950](:bib:Swadesh1950), but marks the most stable 92 items, and adds eight more items which became then the list of 100 items as shown here. In the list, we marked the eight additional items with an asterisk preceding the concept label. Since this list was only implicitly provided in Swadesh's original publication, we ordered the items alphabetically.	133-137	Swadesh-100
Swadesh-1952-200	Swadesh, Morris	1952		200	basic	English	Global		Swadesh1952	Swadesh1952	Swadesh's famous list of 200 supposedly stable concepts.	456f	Swadesh-200

In this list, 10 items from the original list were removed and 10 new items were added. The list was proposed much earlier than the source, apparently already in the beginning of the 1960ies ([Djačok 2008](:bib:Djacok2008]), but Yakhontov never published his list officially. Note that there is a spelling error in the source of [Starostin (1991: 91)](:bib:Starostin1991): In the source, the second item is labelled «течь» («float») in Russian, although the alphabetical order suggests that «жечь» («burn tr.») was originally intended by the author.	93	
Samarin-1967-100	Samarin, William J.	1967		100	basic	English, Spanish, French, German	Global		Samarin1967	Samarin1967	As the original source suggests, the list is intended to serve as a starting point for field work, and according ot the compiler, the list was originally provided by Swadesh himself and then slightly modified by the author. The compiler of the list seems to be indifferent regarding the validity of lexicostatistics, but deems the word lists quite useful for comparison with other resources. In the study, the author also presents a [200-item list](:ref:Samarin-1967-218) which in fact contains 218 items.	221-223	
Gabelentz-1891-120	Gabelentz, Hans Georg Conon von der	1891		121	historical	German	Global		Gabelentz1891	Gabelentz1891	This list is not a real concept list in the strict sense, but rather a proposal for a useful semantic ordering of lexical entries for the purpose of language comparison. Gabelentz himself calls these «Collectaneen zum Verwandtschaftsnachweise» («collections [of words] for the purpose of proving language relationship»), and instead of providing strict glosses to be translated into different languages, he provides a schema on how a given collection of lexical entries can be ordered in order to ease the work of historical linguists. Despite the fact that this is no real concept list, we thought it would be useful to include it inour collection, since it illustrates one important purpose of concept lists: to provide an initial heuristic to search for probably related words. Since Gabelentz does not provide direct glosses as examples for all parts of his schema, we added some hopefully useful examples in all those cases where an original gloss was missing. These cases, which constitute the majority of this concept list, are marked with help of an asterisk preceding the gloss.	177f	
Leibniz-1768-128	von Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm	1768		128	historical	Latin	Global		Leibniz1768	Leibniz1768	This list is part of the fifteenth <em>desideratum</em> expressed by Leibniz in a letter to Dn. Podesta where he tries to encourage the collection of language resources, and among these, lists of words expressing «things of daily use» (<em>res usitiatiores</em>. The list contains 128 concepts. Unfortunately, we were not yet able to determine, when this list was published first. Our source stems from the first complete edition of Leibniz' opus which was published in 1768 by Louis Dutens.	230	
Pallas-1789-285	Pallas, Peter Simon	1789		285	historical	Russian, Latin	Global		Pallas1789	Pallas1789	This list corresponds to a large dictionary, commissioned by Catherine the Great and compiled by Peter Simon Pallas, which was intended to describe all languages of the world. The list itself is a reduced list of the [larger list](:ref:Pallas-1786-442). The list is not a completely reduced form of the original list, but also contains certain revisions. As an example, the concept «hand», which is ambiguous in Russian, where it may also refer to «arm» was now explicitly translated as *manus* in Latin, thus making it very clear that the broader concept «arm / hand» was no longer intended.	493-494	
Pallas-1786-442	Pallas, Peter Simon	1786		442	historical	Russian, German, Latin, French	Global		Pallas1786	Pallas1786	This is a very early collection of words compiled for the purpose of language comparison. From the digital version of the source, the original date of publication could not be determined. However, according to [Adelung (1815: 53)](:bib:Adelung1815), the collection was published in 1786 by order of Catherine the Great, in order to create a large collection of words from all languages in the world. Later, the list was reduced to [285 words](:ref:Pallas-1789-285), and the translations were published in two volumes. The count of 442 items is based on our digitization of the source. As a matter of fact, the item «to sing» occurs twice in the data with the exact identical Russian, French, and Latin words.	03. Aug	
Ardila-2007-40	Ardila, Alfredo	2007		40	naming test	English,Spanish,Esperanto,Latin,Turkish,Basque,Russian,Sikuani	Global	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acn.2007.01.016	Ardila2007	Ardila2007	This list was created as an alternative to current *naming tests* which are used in medicine to determine degrees of aphasia and for similar purposes. For this reason, the tests are usually accompanied by images, and the same holds for [this test](http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S088761770700011X-gr1.jpg), which, in contrast to earlier tests, like the Boston Naming Test, uses the idea of Swadesh lists as a new starting point for the creation of a test list. According to the author, the list has 38 items from the list of [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and 2 items from the list of [Swadesh (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), namely «snake» and «worm». The item selection was based on different factors, including recognizability on images, a coverage of five core semantic categories. Note that the list we give here was merged from two tables in the original paper (one containing the test items, the other translations in additional languages).	300305	
Key-2016-1310	Key, Mary Ritchie and Comrie, Bernard	2015		1310	questionnaire	English, Russian, French, Portuguese, Spanish	Global	http://ids.clld.org	Key2016		This is the most recent version of the concept list underlying the [Intercontinental Dictionary Series](https://ids.clld.org/) which was first launched in 2007 and now significantly enhanced and expanded (while the concept list itself was left unchanged). The list also served as the core list underlying the [World Loanwoard Database](http://wold.clld.org) and was used for the investigation of cross-linguistic colexification patterns in the [CLICS database](http://clics.lingpy.org).

Peust-2013-54	Peust, Carsten	2013		54	ratings	English	Global	http://www.peust.de/peustBasicVocabularyList.pdf	Peust2013	Peust2013	This list is the result of applying a procedure for stability-checking by comparing the survival rate of words in couples of ancestral and descendant languages in 13 such pairs. This procedure for stability checking is different from the ones proposed by [Starostin (2007)](:ref:Starostin-2007-110), [Holman et al. (2008)](:ref:Holman-2008-40), and [Pozdniakov (2014)](:ref:Pozdniakov-2014-100a). The column STABILITY in the data reflects the degree of the correponding category for each concept and ranges from 1 to 6.	14	
Pozdniakov-2014-100a	Pozdniakov, Konstantin	2014	a	100	ranked	English	Global	http://jolr.ru/files/(144)jlr2014-11(187-237).pdf	Pozdniakov2014	Pozdniakov2014	This list presents an alternative ranking of the data underlying the ranked list presented by [Starostin (2007)](:ref:Starostin-2007-110). In contrast to the original ranking, it calculates the results by averaging them. Given that we know the original data underlying this list, the mapping to concept sets was carried out by comparing with our mapping of Starostin's ranked list. As a result, there are some mappings which may seem unintuitive («ground» being mapped to «EARTH (SOIL)»), but they result from different translations from the Russian source into English, not from wrong mappings.  200	202	
Tadmor-2009-100	Tadmor, Uri	2009		100	ranked	English	Global	http://wold.clld.org/meaning	Tadmor2009	Tadmor2009	This list is assumed to contain concepts which are not only stable but also resistant to borrowing. The concepts were selected with help of the [World Loanword Database](http://wold.clld.org) which contains various information regarding lexical borrowing in different languages of the world. It is known under the name «Leipzig-Jakarta list».	69-71	Leipzig-Jakarta
Swadesh-1955-215	Swadesh, Morris	1955		100	ranked	English	Global		Swadesh1955	Swadesh1955	Apart from Swadesh's most famous concept list of [100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), the article from 1955 gives the full [list of 215 items](:ref:Swadesh-1950-215) first presented in [1950](:bib:Swadesh1955) in ranked form with stability percentages and assignment of all items to semantic fields. This list combines two tables in the paper, the table which groups the items according to categories, and the table showing the stabilities. Items marked with an asterisk refer to those 92 items which were later selected for the 100 item list (eight more items are only mentioned in the text but not included in the table). In some cases the concept labels slightly diverged in the two tables. This was indicated by adding the different concept label in the list on semantic categories (page 133) to the main field and separating it by a back slash.	133-137	
Starostin-2007-110	Starostin, Sergej A.	2007		110	ranked	Russian	Global		Starostin2007	Starostin2007	This is a ranked version of the «traditional» concept list of the [Tower of Babel](http://starling.rinet.ru) project.	838

Goddard-2001-42	Goddard, Cliff	2001		42	specific	English	Global		Goddard2001	Goddard2001	This list contains concept labels for 42 semantic primes (taken from proposals based on [Natural Semantic Metalanguage](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Semantic_Metalanguage)) which the author, based on a closer investigation outlined in the paper, claims to be universal.	57	
Yakhontov-1991-35	Yakhontov, Sergej	1991		35	stable,ultra-stable	Russian, English	Global		Starostin1991	Starostin1991	This is the supposedly most stable part of [Yakhontovs list of 100 items](:ref:Yakhontov-1991-100).	93	
Starostin-2010-50	Starostin, George S.	2010		50	ultra-stable	English	Global		Starostin2010	Starostin2010	This list is used by the [GLD](http://starling.rinet.ru/new100/main.htm) project to test deep genetic relations between languages. It is supposed to represent very stable items. The stability was determined with help of the ranking procedure that was also underlying [Starostin's ranked list of 110 items](:ref:Starostin-2007-110). The list does not mechanically derive from the ranked list, but contains some concepts which were chosen for pragmatic reasons. The concept «liver», for example, was excluded, although it is very stable, but since it is not often not included in language surveys and available wordlists.	113	
Pagel-2013-23	Pagel, Mark and Atkinson, Quentin D. and Calude, Andreea S. and Meade, Andrew	2013		23	ultra-stable	English	Global		Pagel2013	Pagel2013	This list gives supposedly very stable meanings for Eurasian languages, based on an investigation of cognate sets across etymological dictionaries.	8474	
Borin-2012-40	Borin, Lars	2012		40	ultra-stable	English	Global		Borin2012	Borin2012	This list contains those concepts which occur in 8 of the 9 languages investigated in the [KELLY](http://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/kelly) project, which aims at developing vocabularies for different proficiency levels of the [CEFR](http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/cadre1_en.asp). In contrast to most of the other concept lists in our sample, it is thus oriented towards basic concepts for language learning, rather than basic concepts for language comparison.	62	
Trask-2000-15	Trask, Robert L.	2000		15	ultra-stable	English	Global		Trask2000	Trask2000	According to the author, this list is the [15-item list by Dolgopolsky (1964)](:ref:Dolgopolsky-1964-15). It deviates, however, both in the concept labels which were used in the [English translation from 1986](:bib:Dolgopolsky1986) and in the literal translation of Dolgopolsky's list. It is therefore much more likely that Trask quoted Dolgopolsky's list intermediately from [Shevoroshkin's list of 23 items](:ref:Shevoroshkin-1991-23). Since this list is again a rather specific translation of Dolgopolsky's list, it explains why Trask's list of Dolgopolsky and Dolgopolsky's list deviate in the item «louse» which Trask (following Shevoroshkin) translates as «louse/nit».	96	
Beaufils-2015-18	Beaufils, Vincent	2015		18	ultra-stable	English	Global	http://www.elinguistics.net/Lexical_comparison.html	Beaufils2015	Beaufils2015	This list is proposed as part of the [eLinguistics.net project](http://www.elinguistics.net) which aims to automatically compare languages all over the world by means of 18 words which are converted to sound classes and compared for similarity by using pre-established scores for sound-correspondence probability (using the findings by [Brown et al. 2011](:bib:Brown2013)). According to the compiler, the selection of the words was based on a comparison of proposed concept lists (e.g. by [Jakhontov](:ref:Yakhontov-1991-35), [Dolgopolsky](:ref:Dolgopolsky-1964-15), and [Holman](:ref:Holman-2008-40)) along with a test of the performance of the words in producing senseful language trees based on the algorithm proposed by the eLinguistics.net project.		
Dolgopolsky-1964-15	Dolgopolsky, Aaron B.	1964		15	ultra-stable	Russian, English	Global		Dolgopolsky1964, Dolgopolsky1986	Dolgopolsky1964, Dolgopolsky1986	This list proposed by A. Dolgopolsky in 1964 was claimed to be «ultrastable», reflecting concepts which are barely replaced during language evolution. Since Dolgopolsky makes no distinction between «who» and «what», the list can be mapped to more than just the proposed 15 concepts in other concept lists (such as, for example, the [100 item list by Swadesh](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100)).	55, 34f	
Holman-2008-40	Holman, Eric W. and Wichmann, Søren and Brown, Cecil H. and Velupillai, Viveka and Müller, Andreas and Bakker, Dik	2008		40	ultra-stable	English	Global	http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Soren_Wichmann/publication/40853552_Explorations_in_automated_language_classification/links/09e41508a4943d4255000000.pdf	Holman2008	Holman2008	This list is supposed to be very stable and has been used as the reference list for the [ASJP project](http://asjp.clld.org) in which 40-word lists of more than two thirds of all languages of the world were collected. We provide the original rankins along with the [list of 100 items](:ref:Holman-2008-100).		ASJP
Shevoroshkin-1991-23	Shevoroshkin, Vitalij V. and Manaster Ramer, Alexis	1991		23	ultra-stable	English	Global		Shevoroshkin1991	Shevoroshkin1991	This list is an extension to [Dolgopolsky's short list of 15 items](:ref:Dolgopolsky-1964-15). According to the compilers, it was obtained by slightly relaxing Dolgopolsky's original criteria for concept selection.	188f	
Meillet-1921-16	Meillet, Antoine	1921		16	ultra-stable	French	Global		Meillet1965, Hymes1960		This is not a real list proposed by Meillet, but rather a collection of examples for words which are less frequently replaced during language history. The original list was published in 1921, but for our research we had to rely on a later edition from 1965, which is why we can't provide the exact page on which the original «list» can be found.	?, 5	
Yakhontov-1991-65	Yakhontov, Sergej	1991		65	unstable	Russian, English	Global		Starostin1991	Starostin1991	This is the supposedly less stable part of [Yakhontovs list of 100 items](:ref:Yakhontov-1991-100).	93	
Swadesh-1960-100b	Swadesh, Morris	1960	b	100	unstable	English	Global		Hymes1960	Hymes1960	According to the source, this list was proposed by Swadesh as a diagnostic test list that could supplement the [list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) in case researchers would face difficulties in identifying all translational equivalents for the 100 item list. Unfortunately, the only source which we could find for this list, [Hymes (1960)](http:bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Hymes1960), presents the concept glosses in an abbreviated form which does not allow us to distinguish whether we are dealing with verbal or nominal meanings. As a confusing result of this, the concept «rain» occurs twice, both in this [stable list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1960-100a) (item 76) and in this supplementary list (item 121).	6	
Ringe-2002-333	Ringe, Donald and Warnow, Tandy and Taylor, Ann	2002		333	areal	English	Indo-European	http://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/CPHL/ie-wordlist-07.pdf	Ringe2002	Ringe2002	This list was used for a cladistic study of 24 Indo-European languages ([Ringe et al. 2002](:bib:Ringe2002)). The authors describe the list as being derived from the two traditional Swadesh lists ([Swadesh 1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), and [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100)), to which they added an additional number of 121 lexical items which are supposed to be indicative of subgrouping of Indo-European languages. The first two Swadesh lists originally make up about 207 items, but since the compilers further split five items into two sets, the «Swadesh part» of the list consists of 212 items in total. For this reason, the complete list contains 333 items. The compilers give further specifications of some of their concepts which we added in an additional column called ANNOTATION. Since many of these specifications are, however, optional, they were not entirely considered to carry out the mapping.		
Dyen-1992-200	Dyen, Isidore and Kruskal, Joseph B. and Black, Paul	1992		200	basic	English	Indo-European	http://www.wordgumbo.com/ie/cmp/iedata.txt	Dyen1992		This is the famous concept list underlying the Dyen, Kruskal, and Black database which was first presented in 1992 but later published electronically in 1997. The database was used for multiple studies and inspired the creation of IELex as a successor database, with an [expanded list of 207 concepts](:ref:Dunn-2012-207). Regarding the intended concepts, the list is entirely identical with [Swadesh's 200 item list](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200). Regarding the concept labels, however, the list shows some slight differences. For a ranked version of this list, based on the inferred stability of words in a phylogenetic analysis, see the list by [Pagel et al. (2007)](:ref:Pagel-2007-200).		
Dunn-2012-207	Dunn, Michael	2012		207	basic	English	Indo-European	http://ielex.mpi.nl/meanings/	Dunn2012		This list of 207 items used in the [Indo-European Lexical Cognacy Database](http://ielex.mpi.nl) is a close but not exact merger of [Swadesh's list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and his [list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). It is not exact, since transitive and intransitive forms of the verb to burn which occur separately in the initial lists, are merged into one item. This list is also used as the basic list behind the [Wiktionary Swadesh Lists](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Spanish_Swadesh_list) (see the [Wiktionary swadesh list](:ref:Wiktionary-2003-207)).		
McMahon-2005-30	McMahon, April and McMahon, Robert	2005		30	hihi	English	Indo-European		McMahon2005	McMahon2005	This is what the authors call a «hihi» list for Indo-European languages in the database by [Dyen et al. (1997)](:bib:Dyen1997), that is, a list high in «reconstructability» and high in «retentiveness». So the items are supposed to be among the most stable concepts that can be found in the Indo-European languages.	109	
McMahon-2005-23	McMahon, April and McMahon, Robert	2005		23	lolo	English	Indo-European		McMahon2005	McMahon2005	This is what the authors call a «lolo» list for Indo-European languages in the database by [Dyen et al. (1997)](:bib:Dyen1997), that is, a list low in «reconstructability» and low in «retentiveness». So the items are supposed to be among the less stable concepts that can be found in Swadesh-style databases for Indo-European languages.	109	
Buck-1949-1110	Buck, Carl Darling	1949		1108	questionnaire	English	Indo-European		Buck1949	Buck1949	This famous resource on words of similar meanings in Indo-European languages was the basis for later large word list collections like [WOLD (Haspelmath and Tadmor 2009)](:ref:Haspelmath-2009-1460), and [IDS (Key and Comrie 2015)](:ref:Key-2016-1310). Due lack of resources we are not able to provide a list which was fully digitized from the book, but had to rely on the index in the end of the book, and a semi-automatic comparison with the list by Haspelmath and Tadmor. A larger amount of concepts was also left unlinked, since they seem to be too specific to justify their inclusion in this resource at the moment. So when using this list for important studies, we recommend to check with the original to make sure there are no errors. If errors are detected, we further appreciate to be notified via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/concepticon/concepticon-data).	1505-1515	Buck
Dyen-1964-154	Dyen, Isidore	1964		154	ranked	English	Indo-European		Dyen1964	Dyen1964	This list represents the original [list of 200 items by Swadesh](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) which was ranked by comparing the amount of cognate pairs found in 39 Indo-European languages, with items of low ranks representing items which have a high amount of cognate pairs when comparing all languages in a pairwise fashion. The author gives also a [ranked list for Malayo-Polynesian languages](:ref:Dyen-1964-196). Since the majority of languages was taken from [Buck's (1949) dictionary](:bib:Buck1949), and the author had problems in covering all meanings of the 200 item list, the list was reduced to 154 items. Of the 154 items, however, only 153 appear in the ranking, due to a typesetting error with a missing concept for rank 133.	242f	
Pagel-2007-200	Pagel, Mark and Atkinson, Quentin D. and Meade, Andrew	2007		200	ranked,basic	English	Indo-European		Pagel2007		This list stems from the database of [Dyen, Kruskal and Black (1992)](:bib:Dyen1992) (see also the [original concept list](:ref:Dyen-1992-200))  and is supposed to directly reflect the list by [Swadesh 1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), yet the concept labels slightly differ from the original concept list. The list presents ranks for the 200 basic concepts, which are retrieved from the calculation of evolutionary rates from phylogenetic analyses on the database by Dyen et al (1992).	supplement	
Kassian-2015-50	Kassian, Alexei and Zhivlov, Mikhail and Starostin, George S.	2015		50	basic, ranked	English	Indo-European-Uralic		Kassian2015b	Kassian2015	This list is based on the supposedly ultra-stable [list of 50 items](:ref:Starostin-2010-50) of the [GLD](http://starling.rinet.ru/new100/main.htm) project and was used to test the relatedness of Indo-European and Uralic. It differs from this list in one item: «liver» was used to replace «louse» since louse posed some problems in the Indo-European reconstruction.	312	
Hattori-1973-200	Hattori, Shirō	1973		200	basic	English	Japanese		Hattori1973	Hattori1973	This concept list of 200 items was proposed as a diagnostic test list for lexicostatistical studies of Japanese dialects. The list slightly differs from [Swadesh's list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), althought the explicitly mentions on page 375 that the englarged 200 item list of Swadesh is being used.	376-287	
Hattori-1961-236	Hattori, Shirō	1961		236	basic	English	Japanese dialects		Hattori1961	Hattori1961	This concept list was the basis for several lexicostatistical studies of the Japanese dialects. The list diverges from [Swadesh's list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) especially in that the author lists additional alternatives for certain of the test items (numbered as *a* and *b*). This list itself was published already earlier than the source we quote here ([Hattori 1954](:bib:Hattori1954)). We quote the later list for practical reasons, since it is taken from a text written in English, and our team currently lacks Japanese speaking colleagues.	55f	
Lee-2011-211	Lee, S. and Hasegawa, Toshiharu	2011		211	basic	English	Japonic		Lee2011	Lee2011	This list is almost completely identical with the list of [210 items by Blust](:ref:Blust-2008-210), but the authors diverge in two positions from the concept labels used in the original list: they write «lightening» instead of «lightning», and «ash» instead of «ashes». The concept «at» also occurs (suprisingly) two times in their list, both times with other reflexes in the data. For this reason, we count 211 concept for this concept lists, not 210, as in the list by Blust.		
Nagaraja-2013-200	Nagaraja, K. S. and Sidwell, Paul and Greenhill, Simon J.	2013		200	areal	English	Khasian		Nagaraja2013	Nagaraja2013	This list was used for a lexicostatistical investigation of four Khasian languages. Judging from the concept labels, it was directly derived from [Gudschinsky's list of 200 items](:ref:Gudschinsky-1956-200) and is therefore not completely identical with [Swadesh's list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200). Furthermore, the compilers read the concept label «lie» as «lie, deceive», while most other concept lists read it as «lie, rest».	07. Nov	
Dixon-1919-175	Dixon, Roland B. and Kroeber, Alfred L.	1919		173	specific	English	languages of California		Dixon1919	Dixon1919	This is an early example of a concept list which was employed for the purpose of language comparison. Strictly speaking, the list itself contains much less conceptual items than 173, since the authors list items which are expressed by multiple cognate sets in the languages of California separately. In order to get these cognate sets, they used a list of 225 English words which is, unfortunately, not reported in the study. According to the authors, the list of cognate sets contains 175 items, but in the source, only 171 items are listed, with 2 further being labeled as secondary in the source. In order to keep close to the original, we decided to add their concept list in unmodified form to the concepticon.	56-61	
Dyen-1964-196	Dyen, Isidore	1964		196	ranked	English	Malayo-Polynesian		Dyen1964	Dyen1964	This list represents the original [list of 200 items by Swadesh](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) which was ranked by comparing the amount of cognate pairs found in 89 Malayo-Polynesian languages, with items of low ranks representing items which have a high amount of cognate pairs when comparing all languages in a pairwise fashion. The author gives also a [ranked list for Indo-European languages](:ref:Dyen-1964-154).	244-246	
Tryon-1983-200	Tryon, Darrel T. and Hackman, Brian D.	1983		200	areal	English	Melanesian		Tryon1983	Tryon1983	This list is based on the two lists published in [Samarin (1967)](:bib:Samarin1967), and was used to carry out a lexicostatistic subgrouping of the languages of the Solomon islands. The compilers note that they replaced forty items which were found unsuitable for their comparison with alternative concepts. In the list, those concepts which, according to the compilers, stem from [Samarin's list of 100 items](:ref:Samarin-1967-100) are marked with one asterisk, those items which stem from [the list of 200 items](:ref:Samarin-1967-218) are marked with two asterisks, and the 40 additional items are left unmarked. This list is a subset of a larger [list of 324 items](:ref:Tryon-1983-324) that was collected and published along with the source and used for broader investigations, including the determination of regular sound correspondences.	28f

Miller-1994-281	Miller, John D.	1994		281	areal	English	Mon-Khmer		Miller1994	Miller1994	In this list, the author tested the suitability of the [SIL list of 281 items](:ref:SIL-1980-281) to be applied to Mon-Khmer languages in Thailand. The author excludes several items from the original list and retains 203 words in the end. In our representation, these decisions are marked in the column STATUS, with *i* indicating retained elements, *e* excluded elements, and *p* problematic elements. There occurs also one *u*, but this is apparently a spelling error, since the author does not give any further description for that.	72-81	
Thomas-1960-168	Thomas, David	1960		168	ranked	English	Mon-Khmer		Thomas1960	Thomas1960	This list provides stability ranks for four Mon-Khmer languages and compares them with the ranks presented in the [215 item list](:ref:Swadesh-1955-215) from [Swadesh (1955)](:bib:Swadesh1955). The author does not provide all of the 215 items presented in the study by Swadesh, but only a subset of them. The 215 items themselves were first presented in [Swadesh (1950)](:ref:Swadesh-1950-215) where they formed the basis of all initial calculations of Swadesh's lexicostatistics and glottochronology.	08.

Wilson-1969-35	Wilson, Darryl	1969		35	areal	English	New Guinea		Wilson1969	Wilson1969	This is a very small concept list created for the purpose of language comparison in New Guinea. It is not entirely clear from the source how the author ended up with this list of 35 items. According to the source, the author used some standardized list of 100 words, 57 of which also appear on the [100 item list of Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) (see [Wilson 1969: 76](:bib:Wilson1969)). No further information could be found explaining why the 35 items were chosen for the survey.	78

The author apparently started from [Swadeshs list of 215 items](:ref:Swadesh-1950-215) but successively reduced the items due to problems like frequent borrowing, since some of the terms had been culturally introducted (like «snow»), and due to semantic interdependencies (like «dirty» vs. «black»).	34-43

Bowern-2011-204	Bowern, Claire AND Epps, Patience AND Gray, Russell D. AND Hill, Jane AND Hunley, Keith AND McConvell, Patrick AND Zentz, Jason	2011		204	basic	English	Northern American languages, Southern American languages, Australian languages	http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?unique&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0025195.s005	Bowern2011		This concept list consists of 204 concepts, 164 of which derive from Swadesh's [list of 200 concepts](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and [100 concepts](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). Items marked with an asterisk and a dollar sign appear in the 100-item and 200-item lists, respectively. The reasons for the exclusion of concepts were both pragmatic (absence of concepts in the languages under investigation), and theoretical (ambiguity in the target languages).		
Bowern-2012-189	Bowern, Claire and Atkinson, Quentin D.	2012		189	basic	English	Pama-Nyungan		Bowern2012	Bowern2012	This is a basic vocabulary list which was used for a study on Pama-Nyungan languages, originally, the list was larger, containing [204 items](:ref:Bowern-2012-205), but items were excluded since some concepts were hard to translate and other concepts were not independent (showing colexifications). A similar list was used for a [study on hunter gatherer languages](:ref:Bowern-2011-204). Words which do not occur in the [Swadesh 100](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) or [200](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) lists are marked by an asterisk.	825f	
Bowern-2012-205	Bowern, Claire and Atkinson, Quentin D.	2012		205	basic	English	Pama-Nyungan		Bowern2012	Bowern2012	This list was originally intended to be used for a study on Pama-Nyungan languages. It was inspired by an earlier version of the [210 item list of Blust](:ref:Blust-2008-210). Later on, the authors decided to reduce the list by 15 items, since they turned out to be hard to find in for all languages in the sample, or since the were depended in two many languages which would have the same word for two different concepts. Note that the list itself is supposed to have only 204 concepts, but in the source, the authors list 205, with the concept «thou» occuring twice, one time as «you.SG» and one time as «thou». The items which were excluded are marked with a cross in the column named EXCLUDED. Words which do not occur in the [Swadesh 100](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) or [200](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) lists are marked by an asterisk. Items marked with a star occured  A similar list was used for a [study on hunter gatherer languages](:ref:Bowern-2011-204).	825f	
Nelson-2001-89	Nelson, Hans	2001		89	basic	English	Philippine languages		Nelson2001	Nelson2001	This list is a version of [Swadesh's list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) in which those items where removed which were borrowed in all three languages that the author investigated.	58f	
Zorc-1974-100	Zorc, R. David	1974		100	basic	English	Phillipine languages		Zorc1974	Zorc1974	This is supposed to be the typical [100 item Swadesh list](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet the glossing differs from the original, showing some interesting modifications resulting from the target languages used in the investigation.	432f	
Mallory-2006-100	Mallory, James Patric and Adams, Douglas Quentin	2006		100	basic, proto-language	English	Proto-Indo-European		Mallory2006	Mallory2006	This list is an attempt by the authors to translate the [Swadesh's list of 100 concepts](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) to Proto-Indo-European. Given the Indo-European translations provided by the authors as well as their concept labels, the list is not completely identical with the one by Swadesh, although it comes very close. We have tried to include all Indo-European readings which are also given in the source, but do not list the reflexes in the major branches which are also provided by the authors.	97-99	
Bengtson-1994-27	Bengtson, John D. and Ruhlen, Merritt	1994		27	ultra-stable	English	Proto-World	http://merrittruhlen.com/files/Global.pdf	Bengtson1994		This list contains 27 items for which the authors identified «global etymologies» of which they propose that they might reflect one of the oldest reconstructable languages. Given the semantic divergence in the items, we had difficulties in mapping them all sufficiently. For the sake of simplicity, only the first item of two semantically very different items was mapped, if it was separated by a semi-colon in the source. Surprisingly, the item «leg, foot» appears two times in the list, but it does not seem to be an error.	227-236	
Struve-2014-100	Struve, Timothy James	2014		100	basic	English	Quechua		Struve2014	Struve2014	According to the author, this list is based on [Swadesh's list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and was used for the purpose of testing contact relations between Quechua and other language families.	98-93	
Heggarty-2005-150	Heggarty, Paul	2005		150	areal	English, Spanish	Quechua, Aymara		McMahon2005b, McMahon2005		This list was specifically designed to carry out lexical studies of Quechuan and Aymaran languages ([McMahon et al. (2005)](:bib:McMahon2005b)) and kindly provided by the compiler. Inspired by [Matisoff's CALMSEA list](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200) containing concepts which are «Culturally and Linguistically Meaningful for Southeast Asia», but not necessarily for other language areas, Heggarty calls this list the CALMA list («Culturally and Linguistically Meaningful for the Andes»). Apart from the raw list data, the data provided by the author also contains additional columns in which this new list is compared with earlier concept lists, like the two lists proposed by Swadesh ([100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), and [200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200)), and the short list proposed by [Yakhontov (35 items)](:ref:Yakhontov-1991-35).		
Cross-1964-241	Cross, Ephraim	1964		241	areal	English	Romance		Cross1964	Cross1964	This list was designed by the author for a lexicostatistical investigation of Romance languages. Note that the list itself was produced long before Swadesh published his first concept lists (Swadesh [1950](:bib:Swadesh1950), [1952](:bib:Swadesh1952)). It is not easy to interprete what the author intends to say in the paper, but it seems that his approach was partially inspired by Swadesh due to personal communication, but also by an article by [Kroeber and Chrétien (1937)](:bib:Kroeber1937).	480f	
Trask-1996-45	Trask, Robert L.	1996		45	areal	English	Romance languages		Trask1996	Trask1996	This list was presented as an example for the reconstruction of Proto-Romance, and it shows words which apparently have many very good reflexes in the Romance languages.	216	
Swadesh-1950-165	Swadesh, Morris	1950		165	areal	English	Salish		Swadesh1950	Swadesh1950	The first list which was actually used by Morris Swadesh. Initially, Swadesh started from a concept list of 215 items, yet since the data did not allow to identify all of these, he then reduced the test list to 165 items for which he had enough attestations in the Salish languages.	161	
Kitchen-2009-95	Kitchen, Andrew and Ehret, Christopher and Assefa, Shiferaw and Mulligan, Connie J.	2009		95	basic	English	Semitic		Kitchen2009	Kitchen2009	This is a shortend version of [Swadesh's list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) which was used to study Semitic languages. The authors note in the paper that they reduced the list to 96 items (without specifying further reasons), but it seems they excluded 5 items in the end, at least this is the number of words we could identify in their supplementary material. The list contains some deviations from Swadesh's original list, with the most pregnant one being the concept «fly (noun)» which is marked as a verb in Swadesh's original list.		
Woodward-1991-100	Woodward, James	1991		100	areal, sign language	English	sign languages		Woodward1991	Woodward1991	According to the compiler, this concept list was first compiled and employed in 1978 for a comparative study of the LESCO and ASL sign languages. Since almost all sign languages denote body parts iconically, by pointing to them, the classical lists by Morris Swadesh, such as his [list of 100 items (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), or his [list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) turned out to be insufficient for comparative studies of sign languages. This list was published in many different references. We quote here the earliest version we could find ([Woodward 1978](:bib:Woodward1978) doesn't contain a full list). Later versions differ slightly in their label for 19, which is alternatively labeled as either «fat» ([Woodward 1993](:bib:Woodward1993)) or «grease» ([Woodward 2009](:bib:Woodward2009)).	331

Matisoff-1978-200	Matisoff, James A.	1978		200	areal	English	Sino-Tibetan		Matisoff2000, Matisoff1978	Matisoff2000, Matisoff1978	This list was first proposed in 1978, but our current source is based on a reprinted version of the list published in 2000. The list was intended as a counterpart to «global» concept lists which were proposed by authors such as M. Swadesh ([1955](:bib:Swadesh1955)) as general-purpose lists which ideally would be applicable to all languages of the world. In contrast, Matisoff proposed his list as being «Culturally and Linguistically Meaningful for Southeast Asia» (CALMSEA), but not necessarily for other language areas.	363-368,284-296	
Benedict-1976-100	Benedict, Paul K.	1976		100	basic	English	Sino-Tibetan		Benedict1976	Benedict1976	This list was used to arrive at an initial subgrouping of the Sino-Tibetan languages. As a result, Chinese was identified as the first outgroup. The list is without doubt based on [Swadeshs list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet the concept labels differ to some extent. Benedict mentions another source (Burlin 1971) upon which the list is based, but this source could so far not been inspected.	168	
SatterthwaitePhillips-2011-50	Satterthwaite-Phillips, Damian	2011		50	ultra-stable	English	Sino-Tibetan languages		SatterthwaitePhillips2011	SatterthwaitePhillips2011	This list contains the 50 most stable concepts out of [a base list of 423 concepts](:ref:SatterthwaitePhillips-2011-423). The author uses an automated approach to infer potentially cognate words, and then determines the number of inferred reflexes per syllable.	161-164	
Huber-1992-375	Huber, Randall Q. and Reed, Robert B.	1992		367	questionnaire	Spanish, English	South American		Huber1992	Huber1992	A large concept list originally compiled for the study of South American languages using original concept lists from Swadesh and [Rowe](:ref:Rowe-1954-232). Although it is supposed to contain 375 items, it has, in fact, 367 entries. The missing 8 entries cannot be found in the book and must have been accidentally omitted during printing.	375-381

In this list, only those basic concepts are listed which occur in at least three different word lists, namely the combined lists of Swadesh [(1952, 1955)](:ref:Mann-2004-209), as proposed by Mann himself, the [210-item list by Matisoff (1978)](:ref:Mann-2004-210), also in the analysis of Mann, and the [Southeast Asia 436 wordlist](:ref:SIL-2002-436). Note, that, although this list should actually be based on the larger comparative list of 500 items in the same reference, the concept labels diverge in part from the ones used in the larger list. Thus, instead of «cut», we find «cut (with knife)», and «cloud» is labelled as «cloud (white)».	13-16	
SIL-1980-281	Summer Institute of Linguistics	1980		281	questionnaire,areal	English	South-East Asian Languages		SIL1980	SIL1980	This list of 281 items represents an early list of concepts considered to be useful for research on South-East Asian languages. The list itself was apparently created by building on earlier lists by Swadesh ([1950](:ref:Swadesh-1950-215) and [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100)), and later extended by adding more items, but it is essentially based on the lists of Samarin (1967), especially the longer [list of 218 items](:ref:Samarin-1967-218). The list indicates items which belong to Swadesh's original 100 item list by adding an asterisk to the number, and items belonging to Swadesh's larger list of 215 items by adding the symbol «=» to the number. In our representation, these symbols are preserved, but were placed in an additional column labelled SWADESH.		
SIL-2002-436	Summer Institute of Linguistics	2002		436	questionnaire,areal	English	South-East Asian languages	http://msea-ling.info/dt-library/libronline.shtml	SIL2002		This list of 436 items, which is also called the MSEA list («Mainland Southeast Asia Wordlist») was developed as an extension from an earlier list of [281 items](:ref:SIL-1980-281) which was developed in the 1960s and 1970s for comparative studies in Vietnam and Cambodia ([Mann 2004: 3](:bib:Mann2004)). It is not entirely clear what the symbols in the column SUBLIST are supposed to mean. In the original, the column is not given any name, and it is only our interpretatin that they point to specific sublists, but there does not seem to be a clear overlap with known sublists (especially not the list of 281 items or any of the lists by Swadesh).

Trick-1983-100	Trick, Doug	1983		100	basic	English	Southern Philippine		Trick1983	Trick1983	This list was used for a lexicostatistical comparison of four languages spoken on the Catanduanes Island. The list originally contained 110 items, whose origin is not further specified in the report, but was reduced to 100 items due to problems of finding good and unambiguous translations for the concepts. The original numbering was, however, retained, although the items which were excluded are not mentioned in such a way that one could re-introduce them in the list.	Appendix E (3 pages).

It is thus one of the earliest lists we could find in which «universal concepts» are used as a heuristic for the proof of genetic relationship between languages. The compiler himself labels the list as «a list of fifty words; of universal use from the nature of the ideas they express» ([Marsden 1782: 154](:bib:Marsden1782)).	Appendix to p. 154	
Krisadawan-2000-210	Krisadawan, Hongladarom	2000		210	areal,documentation	English	Tibetan		Krisadawan2000	Krisadawan2000	This list is taken from a study on Rgyalthang Tibetan, in which it was used to illustrate core aspects of the lexicon. The list is based on [Matisoff's CALMSEA list](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200), yet it shows some peculiarities, such as the numbering of the items and some concept labels. The author also explains that certain items were removed, since they could not be found in the language variety under investigation. Note further that the numbering of the list is potentially erroneous, since the list jumps from 117 directly to 121.	91-93	
SatterthwaitePhillips-2011-423	Satterthwaite-Phillips, Damian	2011		423	questionnaire	English, Chinese	Tibeto-Burman		SatterthwaitePhillips2011	SatterthwaitePhillips2011	This is an expanded meaning list combining parts of the lists proposed by [Matisoff 1987](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200) and the well known lists of [Swadesh (1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and [1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). Note that although the author mentions in his thesis on page 44 that a total of 410 words (meanings) were used to collect the data, we find as many as 423 words, including some duplicate entries, but also some entries which are obviously near synonyms but were probably split into different semantic slots by the author (who himself marks seven additional entries as not belonging to the original concept). The ENGLISH column reflects the concept glosses as listed in Appendix 1 of the work, while the SPREADSHEET column reflects the concept glosses as used in an excel spreadsheet containing the raw data which the author was so friendly to provide us. Entries marked with an asterisk in the SPREADSHEET column seem to reflect items which also occur on traditional concept lists; entries ending on the percentage character are those marked as later added by the author in the original source. Why some entries in the SPREADSHEET column are marked with two greater-then characters in the spreadsheet data of the author is not entirely clear to us, but we kept it in order to provide all information that is available.	176-239

Note especially the merger of the concepts «heart» and «guts» which caused difficulties in mapping. In the same paper, the authors also derive a supposedly [stable (hihi) subset of 28 items](:ref:Galucio-2015-28) and a [less stable (lolo) subset](:ref:Galucio-2015-34), as well as a [non-basic concept list which mainly contains plant and animal names](:ref:Galucio-2015-90).	249-261

They state in their paper that they use a version of [Swadesh's list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet they add two more items, since they split «to kill» into two concepts (singular versus plural), and also «earth», thereby distinguishing between «earth as soil» and «earth as mud». The data is not shown in their paper but was taken from the supplementary material.		
Janhunan-2008-235	Janhunan, Juha and Peltomaa, Marja and Sandman, Erika and Dongzhou, Xiawu	2008		273	areal	English	Wutun		Janhunan2008	Janhunan2008	This list was used to document basic vocabulary of the Wutun language, an apparently Sinitic language spoken in the Amdo region of Tibet. The numbering of the word list is rather strange, since it is either inconsistent, or there is a system that is not directly understandable for the reader. The authors list general terms which we know from normal basic vocabulary lists, but also cultural variants, yet apart from that, they also list items which are not given a further translation (and which we therefore had to leave unmapped).	118-127

As reported by the authors, it resulted from clustering words from [massive text corpora](:bib:Brysbaert2014) into 180 semantic groups, covering the entire semantic space of the corpora. The most representative concepts, manually selected from each cluster, were then used as input stimuli in three fMRI experiments in order to investigate the relationship between the linguistic representations and the resulting imaging data. The researchers report that semantic information is not confined to a specific brain region, as commonly assumed, but rather distributed across several high-level cortical networks.	1-13

The columns ``FAMILY_FREQUENCY``, ``LANGUAGE_FREQUENCY`` and ``WORD_FREQUENCY`` list the number of times a translation for a given concept occurs in the CLICS3 data. The columns ``DEGREE``, ``WEIGHTED_FAMILY_DEGREE``  and ``WEIGHTED_LANGUAGE_DEGREE`` contain the unweighted and weighted degree for each node.		
Morse-1996-375	Morse, Nancy L.	1996		375	areal, questionnaire	Spanish, English	Sáliba	https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/69059	Morse1996		This list of 375 items was used as a questionnaire for the indigenous South American language Sáliba. The items to be elicited were given both in English and Spanish and originated from a merged concept list of [Rowe](:ref:Rowe-1954-232) and Swadesh, most likely [his 100-item list from 1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). The Swadesh items were additionally marked with an asterisk although we could find some incongruous markings there.

The study conducted seven experiments in which participants learned categories composed of colors and shapes that were either easy or more difficult to name in English. The association values come from [Vanderplas and Garvin (1959)](:bib:Vanderplas1959).	15	
Gauchat-1925-480	Gauchat, Louis and Jeanjaquet, Jules and Tappolet, Ernest	1925		480	questionnaire	French	French dialects of Switzerland		Gauchat1925		This questionnaire was used to study differences between Romandy dialects in Switzerland. It consists of 480 items which often can be taken together to form phrases. Our translation has tried to reflect this in so far as we have not translated the items point-by-point, but rather tried to determine the overall meaning of the intended phrase first. The concept mapping is sporadic and follows a couple of rules. We first mapped all nouns that have a direct article and appear in singular. In a second run, we tried to map missing nouns that had not been mapped, which appear with an indirect article or in plural or other forms. The same was done for the verbs, giving preference where possible to a clear infinitive, rather than inflected verb forms.	2-159	
Ratcliffe-2021-100	Ratcliffe, Robert R.	2020		100	areal, questionnaire	English	Arabic dialects	https://doi.org/10.1163/22105832-01001100	Ratcliffe2021		This concept list is supposed to reflect [Swadesh's list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and was used for a lexicostatistic study of Arabic dialects. The mappings may differ in some cases from the original list of Swadesh, as we had problems to identify some meanings unambiguously from the glosses (for RAIN, for example, no further specification was given). The list was provided in WORD format in the supplementary material of the study and turned out to be corrupted by space characters inserted inside almost all words including the numbers. These spaces were deliberately deleted in our version, to allow for a convenient inspection of the list.	1-29	
Davletshin-2012-100	Davletshin, Albert	2012		100	basic, proto-language	English	Uto-Aztecan languages	https://doi.org/10.31826/9781463235406-005	Davletshin2012	Davletshin2012	The concepts for this list were taken from [Swadesh's 100-item list](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and formed the basis for comparing 9 different Uto-Aztecan languages. Based on this comparison, the author proposed possible corresponding forms of Proto-Aztecan. The concept «small» is actually missing from the proto-word list but was included in the Aztecan word list on pp. 84-90.	91	
Yao-2017-1100	Yao, Zhao and Wu, Jia and Zhang, Yanyan and Wang, Zhenhong	2017		1100	ratings	English, Chinese	Chinese	https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0793-2#Sec12	Yao2017		This data set contains ratings for affective variables (i.e., valence and arousal) and various semantic variables (concreteness, imageability, context availability, and familiarity) of 1,100 Chinese words. The ratings for all variables were collected with 9-point Likert scales. 	1374-1385	
Grierson-1928-168	Grierson, George Abraham	1928		168	basic, questionnaire	English	South Asian languages	https://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/lsi	Grierson1928		This list of 168 items for more than 380 language varieties edited by Grierson [Grierson 1928](:bib:Grierson1928) from the comparative vocabulary volume.	2-337	
Hartmann-2013-162	Hartmann, Iren and Haspelmath, Martin and Taylor, Bradley	2013		162	questionnaire	English	Global	http://valpal.info	Hartmann2013		The online database ValPaL (Valency Patterns Leipzig) was created to study behaviour of verbs in different valency contexts. The concepts in this list are meant to be representative of the verbal lexicon and are reported as showing distinctive syntactic behaviour within and across languages.		
Lundgren-2020-275	Lundgren, Olof	2020		275	areal	English	The Tupí–Guaraní languages Omagua and Kokama and their closest relative Tupinambá	https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/9007022	Lundgren2020		This 275-item list underlies the result of cognate detection in the Tupí–Guaraní languages Omagua and Kokama and their closest relative Tupinambá. The initial lexical data was drawn from the Tupí–Guaraní Comparative Lexical Dataset ([Chousou-Polydouri et al. 2019](:bib:ChousouPolydouri2019)). The cognate data were then used for the phonological reconstruction of their most recent common ancestor, Proto-Omagua–Kokama–Tupinambá.	89-97	
Ruhlen-1998-36	Ruhlen, Merritt	1998		36	basic, areal	English	Yeniseian and Na-Dene	https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/95/23/13994.full.pdf	Ruhlen1998		The basic concepts in this list serve to compare Proto-Yeniseian and Proto-Na-Dene cognates which are not widely shared by other language families. The author argues that this large amount of cognates of basic vocabulary can only be explained by a common ancestor language.	13995-13996

Urban-2016-160	Urban, Matthias	2016		160	basic	English	Global		Urban2016	Urban2016	This list of 160 nominal items was compiled in order to compare morphological complexity across 78 languages of different language families. The concepts were organized into four semantic categories relating to nature, artifacts, the body and temporal concepts (plus some miscellaneous words). The list is not directly based on another concept list, although [Brown 1999](:bib:Brown1999) and [Buck 1949](:ref:Buck-1949-1110) provided some inspiration.	571-572	
Sims-2020-253	Nathaniel A. Sims	2020		253	proto-language, areal	English	Northeastern Trans-Himalayan language varieties spoken in Sìchuān, China	https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/52460	Sims2020		The given list underlies the study on the reconstruction of tone for the proto-Rma language. It re-examines the data, taken from [Evans 2001](:bib:Evans2001) and [Sims 2014](:bib:Sims2014), and draws on the cognates from the non-tonal Rónghóng variety [LaPolla and Huang 2003](:bib:LaPolla2003). Although previous research suggested that proto-Rma was a non-tonal language and that tonal varieties underwent tonogenesis, the current study provides the evidence that proto-Rma had a two-way tonal contrast.		
Josserand-1983-188	Josserand, Judy Katherine	1983		188	basic, areal	Spanish, English	Mixtec languages		Josserand1983	Josserand1983	This concept list consists of 188 cognate sets [Josserand (1983)](:bib:Josserand1983) used for subgrouping. The cognate sets cover 120 varieties (coverage differs across cognate sets) and a proto-Mixtec reconstruction for each concept. Tones are not marked.	489-678	
Duerr-1987-110	Dürr, Michael	1987		110	basic, areal	English	Mixtec languages		Durr1987	Duerr1987	This concept list consists of 110 cognate sets across 17 varieties of Mixtec including a proto-Mixtec reconstruction for each. It was used by [Dürr (1987)](:bib:Durr1987) for tone reconstruction. It overlaps to some degree with Josserand 1983.	38-55	
Zhang-2019-308	Zhang, Shuya and Jacques, Guillaume and Lai, Yunfan	2019		308	basic		rGyalrong and Old Chinese	https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_3149499	Zhang2019		This list of 308 items was extracted from a study on cognates among rGyalrong languages and Old Chinese. Since the data is a collection of etymological items with very divergent meanings and elicitation glosses, we assembled the data for each language separately and added a unified layer of translation.	73-92	
Wu-2020-150	Wu, Winston and Nicolai, Garrett and Yarowsky, David	2020		150	basic, ranked	English	Global	https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.519	Wu2020	Wu2020	The given list is a result of the automatic creation of the core vocabulary, based on the relative coverage of each target concept across 1895 bilingual dictionaries found in the LanguageNet multiligual lexicon [(Baldwin et al. 2010)](:bib:Baldwin2010). It represents a subset of the 150 most frequent glosses from the larger 3000-item vocabulary, sorted in descending order.	4212	
Steinthal-1875-1549	Steinthal, Chajim Heymann	1875		1549	historical, questionnaire	German	Global	https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/121160#page/565/mode/1up	Steinthal1875		The article from which this concept list was taken was intended as a guide for non-linguist travellers to gather language information on a scientific basis and includes sections on vocabulary, grammar, phonology, and means of acquiring reliable linguistic data. The items themselves stem only from the section «Zum Wortschatz» (On Vocabulary). In addition to concepts from many domains, they include some anthropological notes as well as general concept categories. Wherever feasible, those broader categories (e.g. fingers of the hand, cardinal directions or numbers from 1 to 100) were broken up into concrete concepts, which is why there are the columns ORIGINAL (the concepts and categories as found in the source) and GERMAN (the broken down and split up concepts).	560-565	
Dellert-2018-1016	Dellert, Johannes and Buch, Armin	2018		1016	ranked, relations	German	Global	https://figshare.com/s/c9cf9057614928909d86	Dellert2018		This list provides information on basicness and stability for 1,016 concepts. The concepts are ranked by their suitability for inclusion in Swadesh-style lists of basic stable concepts. The stability measure for a concept is called local-global distance correlation (lgc). The average information content (inf) is the measure for basicness.		
Goddard-2011-63	Goddard, Cliff	2011		63	specific	English	Global		Goddard2011	Goddard2011	This list contains concept labels for 63 semantic primes based on the proposals of [Natural Semantic Metalanguage](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Semantic_Metalanguage). The data is taken from a chart that provides an overview of the semantic primes including explanations. Whenever possible, the explanations were composed in semantic primes.		
Baroni-2011-200	Baroni, Marco and Lenci, Alessandro	2011		200	relations	English	English	https://sites.google.com/site/geometricalmodels/shared-evaluation	Baroni2011		This list contains 200 concrete nouns (100 animate and 100 inanimate) from different semantic fields. The data includes information on the following semantic relations: hyperonymy, cohyponymy, meronymy as well as typical attributes, events, and random associations. It can be used as a benchmark for computational models. The relations were selected by the authors using a number of sources, including WordNet, ConceptNet, Wikipedia and the semantic norms of [McRae et al. (2005)](:bib:McRae2005).		BLESS
Hill-2015-999	Hill, Felix and Reichart, Roi and Korhonen, Anna	2015		999	relations	English	English	https://fh295.github.io/simlex.html	Hill2015		SimLex999 is a set of 999 associations between two word pairs containing similarity annotations and concreteness values for each word pair. The word pairs were split into two lines to make a mapping to the Concepticon concepts possible. Note that the order is only relevant to the column ASSOCIATION_STRENGTH.		SimLex999
Luangthongkum-2019-341	Luangthongkum, Theraphan	2019		341	questionnaire, areal	English	Karenic varieties spoken in Thailand	https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/52441/D01Luangthongkum2019view.pdf	Luangthongkum2019		The given 341-item list was created in the reconstruction of the phonology and lexicon of Proto-Karen, based on the ten selected Karenic varieties spoken in Thailand. The data for the analysis comes from the author’s fieldwork notes, made in the North and West of Thailand.	xvi-xliv	
Pepper-2020-100	Pepper, Steve	2020		100	specific	English	Global		Pepper2020		The items in this list were used for a typological investigation of the morphology and semantics of binominal lexemes, i.e. of concepts typically expressed by nominal compounds, across 106 different languages.	393-394	
PharaoHansen-2020-100	Pharao Hansen, Magnus	2020		100	basic, areal	Spanish	Southern Uto-Aztecan languages		Pharao2020		The given 100-item list was initially taken from [Miller-1984-100](:ref:Miller-1984-100) and was used in the preliminary analysis of the relationship between the six selected languages within the Southern Uto-Aztecan branch based on a wide range of empirical data.		
Miller-1984-100	Miller, Wick R.	1984		100	basic, areal	Spanish	Uto-Aztecan languages		Miller1984	Miller1984	The current list represents a modified version of [Swadesh-1955-100](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) with twelve substitutions. The pronouns and demonstratives found in Swadesh-1955-100 were omitted and replaced with the concepts denoting simple actions (e.g. SING, VOMIT) and natural phenomena (e.g., WIND, SNOW, SKY). The resulted list was used in the reconstruction of the Uto-Aztecan language tree based on the investigation of cognate sets in the selected thirty-two languages.	9-12	
Mountain-1978-267	Mountain, Kathy	1978		267	areal	Spanish	Tucanoan languages		Mountain1978		This list compares 267 concepts across 12 different Tucanoan languages of South America. The concepts were taken from a merged 375-item list containing concepts attributed to both Swadesh and [Rowe](:ref:Rowe-1954-232); the original concept numbers of that foundational list are indicated in the respective column here.	10-53	
Loukotka-1954-45	Loukotka, Čestmír	1954		45	basic, areal	Spanish, English	South American languages		Rowe1954	Rowe1954	This 45-item list was used in a comparative study of South American languages and served as the basis for their preliminary classification ([Loukotka 1944](:bib:Loukotka1944)). Since the list is not readily available as it was not officially provided by the author, it was retrieved from [Rowe 1954](:bib:Rowe1954). Moreover, the study contains a lot of unpublished material, and Loukotka gives no discussion of the evidence for the classification which is claimed to be based on a rather rudimentary method. What also needs to be mentioned is the discrepancy between the Spanish gloss *tigre* and its English translation *wildcat*, added by the author himself. We suspect that the reference was made in relation to the so-called «big cat», the more general term of wild cat species belonging to the genus Panthera. Interestingly, the same peculiar discrepancy could also be found in [Huber-1992-375](:ref:Huber-1992-375), which seems to confirm our assumption.	24	
Chacon-2019-220	Chacon, Thiago Costa and Gonçalves, Artur Garcia and da Silva, Lucas Ferreira	2019		243	basic, areal	Portuguese	Arawakan languages	https://doi.org/10.15446/fyf.v32n2.80814	Chacon2019		A 243-item list (note that the list actually contains 243 items in contrast to the 220 stated in the paper) used as the basis for a comparative and dialectogical analysis of Arawak languages and its varieties from the Upper Rio Negro in Brazil. The data are based on documents created by missionaries in the 1950s. 		
Rowe-1954-232	Rowe, John Howland	1954		232	areal	Spanish	South American languages		Rowe1954b	Rowe1954b	This list was used for a comparison of native South American languages and for exploring their potential relatedness; the items include basic concepts as well as areally specific concepts from the natural domain. It was in part inspired by the works of Curt Nimuendajú and has in turn given rise to a larger concept list termed Swadesh-Rowe which was put together and used mainly by SIL linguists working on South American languages.	137-146	
Williamson-1973-118	Williamson, Kay	1973		118	basic, areal, questionnaire	English, French, German	Benue-Congo languages		Williamson1973		This list was used by members of the West African Linguistic Society to compare basic vocabulary of Benue-Congo languages and to determine the position of Bantu within that subgroup. Language informants as well as previously written texts were used to gather the respective terms for the concepts. The French and German glosses seem to be an addendum to the original English concept list.	xxxiv-xxxvii	
Johansson-2020-344	Johansson, Niklas Erben and Anikin, Andrey and Carling, Gerd and Holmer, Arthur	2020		344	basic	English	Global	https://doi.org/10.1515/lingty-2020-2034	Johansson2020a	Johansson2020a	The given 344-item concept list underlies the analysis of sound symbolic patterns across 245 language families. The supposedly stable and universal items of the concept list include the 56 oppositional concepts from [Johansson (2017)](:ref:Johansson-2017-56), 64 kinship terms two steps from the ego with relative age distinctions, and a combination of classical basic vocabulary lists, such as [Swadesh’s list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1971-100), [the Leipzig-Jakarta list (Haspelmath & Tadmor 2009)](:ref:Tadmor-2009-100), and a list by [Goddard and Wierzbicka’s (2002)](:ref:Goddard-2002-59). The information on the 59 concepts, favoring sound symbolism, is taken from Appendix 1 and added to the column called ``SOUND_SYMBOLIC``, where «1» indicates the concepts with sound-meaning associations whereas «0» means the lack thereof.	262-263	
Johansson-2017-56	Johansson, Niklas Erben	2017		56	basic, specific	English	Global	http://doi.org/10.1075/ill.15	Johansson2017		The present list was compiled in the phonosemantic study which investigated cross-linguistic phoneme distributions of 56 fundamental oppositional concepts across 75 genetically and areally distributed languages. The concepts, selected for this purpose, are organized in antonymous pairs, and the column PAIR reflects which antonyms belong together. The internal order of the items in the column ORDER, with one member being mentioned first, does not imply the hierachical superiority or salience of one element over the other but simply reflects the order in which the words are listed in the source. The concept data for this list were derived from [Swadesh (1971)](:ref:Swadesh-1971-100); [Holman et al. (2008)](:ref:Holman-2008-40); [Pagel et al. (2013)](:ref:Pagel-2013-23); [Goddard and Wierzbicka (2002)](:ref:Goddard-2002-59), and [Willners (2001)](:bib:Willners2001).

Each concept was categorized into human, animal, or human/animal. In addition, the concepts received tags for gender (male/female) and if applicable, a reference for the relation to other body parts (part of, instance of).		
Gabelentz-1892-1074	Gabelentz, Georg von der	1892		1074	historical, questionnaire	German	Global	https://archive.org/details/HandbuchZurAufnahmeFremderSprachen/page/n41/mode/2up	Gabelentz1892		This historical list was compiled as a typological resource for missionaries and travellers who might want to assist in collecting data on foreign languages. The items are grouped by categories reflecting word classes and sub-categories reflecting a semantic ordering.		
Miklashevsky-2018-506	Miklashevsky, Alex	2018		506	ratings	English, Russian	Russian	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10936-017-9548-1	Miklashevsky2018		The list presents normative data on the modality (visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory, and gustatory) ratings, vertical spatial localization of the object, manipulability, imageability, age of acquisition, and subjective frequency for 506 Russian nouns.		
Morucci-2019-643	Morucci, Piermatteo and Bottini, Roberto and Crepaldi, Davide	2019		643	ratings	English, Italian	Italian	https://osf.io/a3bjm/	Morucci2019		The list presents modality norms for 643 Italian adjectives, which referred to one of the five perceptual modalities (touch, audition, vision, smell, and taste) or were abstract. The ratings also include psycholinguistic variables (age of acquisition, familiarity, contextual availability).		
BirketSmith-1928-510	Birket-Smith, Kaj	1928		510	basic, areal, historical	English	Inuinnaqtun and Natsilingmiutut		BirketSmith1928	BirketSmith1928	This list was used by members of the Fifth Thule Expedition (between the years of 1921 to 1924) to collect words from three dialects spoken by the indigenous people living in «Arctic America» (northern Canada). The author notes that a linguistic survey was not the main focus of the expedition, but that a basic linguistic study still was to be attempted, given the «extremely slight material otherwise available from the Central Eskimos». Although the author states that the list has 500 items, it actually has 510 items in total when expanding all alternative glosses in the list and by including the numerals in the total count.		
Chen-2019-61	Chen, I-Hsuan and Zhao, Qingqing and Long, Yunfei and Lu, Qin and Huang, Chu-Ren	2019		61	ratings	English	Chinese	https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Mandarin_Chinese_modality_exclusivity_norms/7747022	Chen2019		The list presents modality exclusivity norms for 61 Chinese adjectives rated on visual, auditory, haptic, gustatory, and olfactory associations. The adjectives are two-character compounds.

The authors also collected ratings of emotion (valence, dominance, and arousal) to assess its role in perceptual space simulation.		
Gallatin-1836-180	Gallatin, Albert	1836		180	basic, areal, historical	English	Native languages in North America		Gallatin1836	Gallatin1836	This list was used in Gallatin’s groundbreaking ethnographic work on the native languages in North America, particularly in the areas west and north-west of the Rocky Mountains. The selection process for items on the list was centered around the idea of showing the differences between the different native languages. As such, the glosses were built from basic vocabulary as well as very general concepts, thought to exist in the majority of languages under investigation.	307-367	
Hale-1846-179	Hale, Horatio	1846		179	basic, areal, historical	English	Native languages in the north-western United States		Hale1846	Hale1846	This list was used to collect basic vocabularies of the native tribes living west of the Rocky Mountains (up to the Pacific coast) in what was formerly known as Oregon Country. The items in the list are derived from [Albert Gallatin’s work](:bib:Gallatin1836) on basic vocabularies in this area.	570-629

It expands upon the earlier list taken from [Bulakh et al. (2013)](:ref:Bulakh-2013-870). The aim of of the Database of Semantic Shifts is to collect and classify semantic shifts attested in the languages of the world. The original data contains some ambiguous glosses enclosed in < and > symbols, which we deliberately ignored here. The network underlying the data is displayed in tabular form: the column LINKS contains the concepts (identified by their NUMBER) that show a shift with the given concept, the column WEIGHTS contains the weights for the links, and the column URLs contains those parts of the URL where the shifts can be found.

LSDO-2019-462	Language and Social Development Organization	2019		462	basic, areal	English	Kuki-chin languages		LSDO2019		This list was used as a questionnaire for an investigation of Chin dialects, carried out by the Language and Social Development Organization in 2019. Nathan Statezni was so kind to share the original data with us.		
List-2020-1365	List, Johann-Mattis	2020		1365	annotated	English	German	https://calc.hypotheses.org/2545	List2020		This concept list was originally compiled to provide German elicitation glosses for the [Intercontinental Dictionary Series](:ref:Key-2016-1310), but since some difficulties in the exact concepts were detected, the list was modified and now offers several elicitation glosses for one and the same elicitation item in the Intercontinental Dictionary Series, where this was assumed to be important by the author.		
Starostin-2017-401	Starostin, George and Kassian, Alexei and Trofimov, Artem and Zhivlov, Mikhail	2017		401	basic, areal	Russian, English	Nostratic languages	https://starling.rinet.ru/new400/	Starostin2017		This concept list, provided in the form of a database, was compiled to perform lexicostatistical analyses on certain Eurasian languages and proto-languages which might have a Nostratic ancestor. The words were chosen to represent basic meanings common to most languages. Furthermore, semantic links were provided which link several closely connected words within the list.		
Cowen-2020-16	Cowen, Alan S. and Keltner, Dacher and Schroff, Florian and Jou, Brendan and Adam, Hartwig and Prasad, Gautam	2020		16	specific	English	Global	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-3037-7	Cowen2020		This list of 16 emotions emerged as a result of a machine-learning analysis of large-scaled video material from 144 countries in Arabic, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, and Vietnamese languages. The purpose of the study was to find out what facial expressions are associated with various naturalistic social contexts and determine culturally universal patterns of context–expression association.

The study we provide as reference is not identical with the concept list which we present here, as it belongs to a later version that was consistently mapped to the Concepticon. As a result, the number of items differs from the number mentioned in the study presenting the database.	1-19	
Anonby-2018-1500	Anonby, Erik and Asadi, Ashraf and Nikravan, Pegah	2018		1500	areal, questionnaire	English, Persian	Native languages of Iran	https://carleton.ca/iran/questionnaires/	Anonby2018		This comprehensive list is used as a field work questionnaire for ALI, the Atlas of the Languages of Iran project. It includes basic as well as areally specific terms and groups them into 12 semantic categories plus multiple subcategories. Many concepts are based on [Snider-2004-1700](:ref:Snider-2004-1700).		
Duong-2020-100	Duong, Thu Hang and Nguyen, Thu Quynh and Nguyen, Van Loi	2020		100	basic, questionnaire	English	La Chí languages in Vietnam	https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/52466/1/JSEALS_Special_Publication_6_Anthropologyoflanguage.pdf	Duong2020	Duong2020	The current list was used to investigate some basic characteristics of the La Chí language spoken in Bản Díu, comparing it with La Chí varieties in Bản Máy and Bản Phùng The concepts are claimed to be generally based on the 100-item list of Swadesh (presumably, the [one that dates back to 1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100)). The data for the analysis come from the materials collected by Nguyễn Văn Lợi, Nguyễn Thu Quỳnh and Dương Thu Hằng during their field trips in the respective regions.	136-138	
Wittmann-1973-200	Wittmann, Henri Gontran	1973		200	basic, areal	French	Mauritian, Haitian		Wittmann1973		This list, based on [Swadesh’s 200 item list](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), was used for lexicostatistical analysis of the relatedness between Caribbean Creoles (represented by Haitian in the list) and Mascarene Creoles (represented by Mauritian). The chosen words of both Creole languages were compared among each other and with French with regards to their homosemantic similarity, yielding a greater relatedness of each Creole to French than to each other. Our mappings generally follow the English concepts in Swadesh; however, the French translations may diverge from them in some cases.	94-98

Johansson-2020-11	Johansson, Niklas Erben and Anikin, Andrey and Aseyev, Nikolay	2020		11	colors, ratings	English	Global	https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-and-cognition/article/color-sound-symbolism-in-natural-languages/537E325E594CFC227056D4FEA6BCD8E3	Johansson2020b	Johansson2020b	This list of 11 color concepts underlies the study on cross-linguistic color sound symbolism. The language data come from the corpus compiled by [Johansson et al. (2020)](:ref:Johansson-2020-344) for an investigation of 344 basic vocabulary items in 245 language families. The acoustic properties of the phonemes were obtained from audio recordings in the Seeing Speech database [Lawson et al. (2015)](:bib:Lawson2015). The characteristics of the colors are represented in the columns MUNSELL, SATURATION, RGB, HUE, HUE_D, WARMTH, SAT_WITZEL, LUMINANCE, A and B. The latter three measurements were calculated based on the previously published CIELAB coordinates in the World Color Survey [Regier, Kay, and Cook (2005)](:bib:Regier2005). The A and B columns represent the coordinates of each color in the CIEL space, a 3D color space with a psychologically meaningful distance metric. SAT_WITZEL refers to the saturation ratings from the study by [Witzel and Franklin (2014)](:bib:Witzel2014). Finally, HUE_D lists the measurements for a darker hue of each color.

The data for this investigation was derived from the [database of cross-linguistic colexifications (CLICS)](clics.clld.org). The columns VALENCE, ACTIVATION, DOMINANCE, CERTAINTY, APPROACH_AVOIDANCE and SOCIALITY correspond with the respective physiological dimensions of the emotion concepts that were rated by users. The ratings are available for 20 out of the 24 terms since the study was carried out before the data were extended.		
Vulic-2020-2244	Vulić, Ivan and Baker, Simon and Ponti, Edoardo Maria and Petti, Ulla and Leviant, Ira and Wing, Kelly and Majewska, Olga and Bar, Eden and Malone, Matt and Poibeau, Thierry and Reichart, Roi and Korhonen, Anna	2021		2244	relations	English, Arabic, Chinese, Welsh, Estonian, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Cantonese	English, Arabic, Chinese, Welsh, Estonian, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Kiswahili, Yue Chinese	https://multisimlex.com/	Vulic2020		Multi-SimLex is a large-scale multilingual resource for lexical semantics. The current version of Multi-SimLex provides human judgments on the semantic similarity of word pairs across a variety of languages. The original list includes 1,888 word pairs that were translated from English into 12 languages (e.g., Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Welsh, Kiswahili). The list was prepared so that individual words were disambiguated to make a mapping to Concepticon possible.		Multi-SimLex
Huttenlocher-1979-225	Huttenlocher, Janellen and Lui, Felicia	1979		225	acquisition	English	English		Huttenlocher1979	Huttenlocher1979	This list contains stimuli from three experiments on the semantic organization of nouns and verbs in early language acquisition. In the list, we have marked the semantic groups to which individual items were assigned in the three experiments. These categories were added by us, as they were not provided in the original data, but rather tacitly assumed.	141-162	
Carvalho-2021-206	de Carvalho, Fernando O.	2021		206	basic, areal	English	Iñapari, Apurinã, Yine		Carvalho2021		The given list consists of 206 cognate sets from the Iñapari, Apurinã, and Yine varieties. The data were employed in a comparative reconstruction of the phonology of their shared ancestor, the Proto-Purus language. Since the data were gathered from multiple dictionaries and grammars on the target languages, some concepts marked with (sp.) appear to refer to different species of the same animal.	96-106	
Thwaites-2020-98	Thwaites, Peter	2020		98	specific	English	English		Thwaites2020		The given 98-item list consists of 49 transitive and 49 intransitive verbs that were employed in a word association task in order to investigate the impact of transitivity of English verbs on response patterns among native English speakers. The intransitive verbs were derived from an online list of verbs based on the search query “English intransitive verbs”. The transitive verbs were selected from the [SUBTLEX-UK database](:bib:vanHeuven2014), and the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English was used to eliminate the verbs with intransitive entries.	481	
Chin-2015-100	Chin, Andy	2015		100	basic	English	Hlai		Chin2015		This concept list, based on the list [of 100 items by Swadesh](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) was used to illustrate the differences between Gelong and neighboring Hlai languages.	151-155

Constenla-2005-110	Constenla Umaña, Adolfo	2005		110	basic	Spanish	Chibchan, Misumalpam and Lencan languages		Constenla2005		The list is a reduced form of a 120-item concept list which the author used in a previous paper on the relationship on Lencan and Misumalpam languages. In this version, the information for Chibchan languages was added to analyze cognates of all three families and argue in favor of an underlying genealogical relationship between them.		
Hantgan-2018-302	Hantgan, Abbie and List, Johann-Mattis	2018		302	basic	English	Bangime and the neighbouring Dogon languages		Hantgan2018		This 302-item list underlies the lexical comparative study on Bangime and its neighbouring Dogon languages. The core of this conceptlist is formed by the data from the Dogon comparative wordlist ([Heath et al. 2015](:bib:Heath2015)), with the addition of data collected for Bangime ([Heath and Hantgan 2018](:bib:Heath2018)), and Jenaama ([Heath 2016](:bib:Heath2016)) while Mande language data were derived from the RefLex database ([Segerer and Flavier 2016](:bib:Segerer2016)).		
Teit-1908-693	Teit, James	1908		693	questionnaire, areal	English	Okagan language and its Sanpoil, Colville and Lake dialects		Doak1983		The given 693-item-list underlies an extended study on the distribution of the dialects of the Interior Salish language, conducted by James Teit in 1908. The original lists are titled  “Vocabulary in Okanagan and Related Dialects” and include three Interior Salishan varieties: Okanagan, Kalispel and Columbia. However, the study the current list was retrieved from focuses on just the Okanagan language and its three varieties, namely Sanpoil, Colville and Lake dialects. The original numbering of the list that indicates 636 entries in total is potentionally problematic as the list is missing number 125 and does not include the “sub-entries”, i.e. groups of related concepts. Moreover, in some cases, English glosses were incomplete so we have added them in square brackets.	42-93	
Koelle-1854-280	Koelle, Sigismund W.	1854		280	basic	English	African languages		Koelle1854		This large concept list, partitioned into 280 items which are subdivided on several occasions, was used to describe and compare the lexicon of 300 African languages.		PolyglottaAfricana
